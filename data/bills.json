Existing law enacted by the Legislature requires the establishment of a program for the issuance of identification cards to qualified patients so that they may lawfully use marijuana for medical purposes, and requires the establishment of guidelines for the lawful cultivation of marijuana grown for medical use. Existing law provides for the licensure of various professions by the Department of Consumer Affairs. Existing law, the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, provides for the regulation of food, drugs, devices, and cosmetics, as specified. A violation of that law is a crime.\n\nThis bill would establish within the Department of Consumer Affairs a Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation, under the supervision and control of the Chief of the Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation, and would require the bureau to license and regulate dispensing facilities, cultivation sites, transporters, and manufacturers of medical marijuana and medical marijuana products, subject to local ordinances. The bill would require a background check of applicants for licensure, as defined, to be administered by the Department of Justice, and submission of a statement signed by an applicant, under penalty of perjury, that the information on his or her application is true, thereby creating a crime and imposing a state-mandated local program. Violation of the provisions related to applying for a conditional license would be punishable by a civil fine of up to $35,000 for each individual violation, or as otherwise specified.\n\nThe bill would make conditional licenses subject to the restrictions of the local jurisdiction in which the facility operates or proposes to operate. The bill would set forth provisions related to the transportation, testing, and distribution of medical marijuana. The bill would prohibit the distribution of any form of advertising for physician recommendations for medical marijuana, unless the advertisement bears a specified notice and requires that the advertisement meet specified requirements and not be fraudulent, deceitful, or misleading. \n\nThe bill would require the State Department of Public Health to promulgate standards for the certification of testing laboratories to perform random sample testing of all medical marijuana products, including standards for onsite testing.\n\nThe bill would establish a system, including apprenticeship and certification, for cannabis employees. The bill would require the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement to maintain and enforce minimum standards of competency and training and to certify cannabis employees. The bill would require the division to establish a cannabis curriculum certification committee to establish educational curriculum standards and to oversee educational providers of cannabis curriculum. The bill would require the Division of Occupational Health and Safety to develop industry-specific regulations for facilities issued a conditional license and would specify that those regulations govern agreements between a facility with more than 20 employees issued a conditional license and labor.\n\nThe bill would establish the Medical Marijuana Regulation Fund and would require the deposit of specified fees collected pursuant to this act into the fund. The bill would continuously appropriate moneys from the fund to the bureau for the purposes of administering this act, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would also establish the Special Account for Environmental Enforcement within the Medical Marijuana Fund. This account would contain money from fees assessed against licensed cultivation facilities and would be continuously appropriated for the enforcement of environmental regulations relating to licensed cultivation sites. The bill would require the deposit of penalty moneys collected pursuant to this bill into the General Fund.\n\nThe bill would provide that it shall not supersede provisions of Measure D, as approved by the voters of the City of Los Angeles, as specified.\n\nThe bill would authorize a city, county, or city and county to administer and enforce these provisions. The bill would require the bureau to establish quality assurance protocols by July 1, 2017, to ensure uniform testing standards of medical marijuana, and would require licensees to comply with these provisions. The bill would further set forth provisions regulating edible medical marijuana products, as specified. By adding these provisions to the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, a violation of which is a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(2) Existing law establishes the Division of Apprenticeship Standards, which audits and regulates apprenticeship programs for various trades, including electricians. \n\nThis bill would require the division to investigate, approve, or reject applications for apprenticeship employees of a licensed cultivation site or a licensed dispensing facility, as defined.\n\n(3) Existing law, the Medical Practice Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians and surgeons by the Medical Board of California. Existing law requires the board to prioritize investigations and prosecutions of physicians and surgeons representing the greatest threat of harm, as specified. Existing law identifies the cases that are to be given priority, which include cases of repeated acts of excessively prescribing, furnishing, or administering controlled substances without a good faith prior examination of the patient. Existing law provides that a violation of the Medical Practice Act is a crime.\n\nThis bill would require the board to consult with the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research on developing and adopting medical guidelines for the appropriate administration and use of marijuana.\n\nThe bill would also make it a misdemeanor for a physician and surgeon who recommends marijuana to a patient for a medical purpose to accept, solicit, or offer any remuneration from or to a licensed dispensing facility in which the physician and surgeon or his or her immediate family has a financial interest. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe bill would provide that specified acts of recommending marijuana for medical purposes without a good faith examination are among the types of cases that should be given priority for investigation and prosecution by the board, as described above. The bill would further prohibit a physician and surgeon from recommending medical marijuana to a patient unless that person is the patient's attending physician, as defined. Because a violation of that provision would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(4) Existing law authorizes the legislative body of a city or county to impose various taxes, including a transactions and use tax at a rate of 0.25%, or a multiple thereof, if approved by the required vote of the legislative body and the required vote of qualified voters, and limits the combined rate of transactions and use taxes within a city or county to 2%.\n\nThis bill would authorize the board of supervisors of a county to impose a tax on the privilege of cultivating, dispensing, producing, processing, preparing, storing, providing, donating, selling, or distributing marijuana or products containing marijuana. The bill would authorize the tax to be imposed for either general or specific governmental purposes. The bill would require a tax imposed pursuant to this authority to be subject to any applicable voter approval requirement.\n\n(5) Existing law exempts qualified patients, persons with valid identification cards, and the designated primary caregivers of qualified patients and persons with identification cards from certain crimes, including possession of concentrated cannabis and marijuana, cultivation of marijuana, and possession of marijuana for sale.\n\nThis bill would also exempt from those crimes an employee, officer, or board member of a licensed cultivation site or a licensed dispensing facility, except as specified.\n\n(6) Existing law regulates the labor practices of agricultural employers.\n\nThis bill would include licensed cultivation sites and licensed dispensing facilities in the definition of agricultural employer.\n\n(7) This bill would provide that its provisions are severable.\n\n(8) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\n(9) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.", "scraped_subjects": ["Medical marijuana."], "bill_id": "AB 266"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00015286"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [], "actor": "lower", "date": "2015-02-11 00:00:00", "+actor_info": {"details": "Assembly (Desk)"}, "action": "Introduced.

Within a specified period of time after filing its original statement and designation and annually thereafter, existing law, the General Corporation Law, requires every foreign corporation, including foreign nonprofit corporations, as specified, to file a statement, known as a Statement of Information, with the Secretary of State containing specified information, including the street address of its principal executive office and its mailing address.\n\nThis bill would authorize the Secretary of State to also obtain address information from the Franchise Tax Board to use in providing notices to a foreign corporation, including these foreign nonprofit corporations. This bill would specifically authorize the Franchise Tax Board to disclose this information.\n\n(2) Existing law authorizes the corporate powers, rights, and privileges of a domestic taxpayer to be suspended, and the exercise of the corporate powers, rights, and privileges of a foreign taxpayer in this state to be forfeited, if certain tax liabilities are not paid or a taxpayer fails to file a tax return. Existing law also authorizes the corporate powers, rights, and privileges of a domestic corporation exempt from income tax to be suspended and the exercise of the corporate powers, rights, and privileges of a foreign corporation in this state exempt from income tax to be forfeited if the organization fails to file the annual information return or a specified statement for organizations not required to file the information return or pay a specified amount due. Existing law requires notice prior to the suspension or forfeiture of a taxpayer's corporate powers, rights, and privileges. Existing law requires the Franchise Tax Board to transmit to the Secretary of State the names of those taxpayers subject to these suspension or forfeiture provisions and thereby makes the suspension or forfeiture effective. Under existing law, the Secretary of State's certificate is prima facie evidence of the suspension or forfeiture.\n\nUnder existing law, a corporation that fails to file a Statement of Information with the Secretary of State within a specified time period and was certified for penalty is subject to suspension rather than penalty. Existing law requires the Secretary of State to provide a notice to the nonprofit corporation informing it that its corporate powers, rights, and privileges will be suspended within a specified time period if the Statement of Information is not filed. If the nonprofit corporation does not file the Statement of Information, existing law requires the Secretary of State to notify the Franchise Tax Board and the nonprofit corporation of the suspension and upon that notification the corporate powers, rights, and privileges of the nonprofit corporation are suspended.\n\nThis bill would make a nonprofit public benefit corporation, a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation, a nonprofit religious corporation, and a foreign nonprofit corporation, subject to administrative dissolution or administrative surrender, as specified, if the nonprofit corporation's corporate powers are, and have been, suspended or forfeited by the Franchise Tax Board for a specified period of time or if the nonprofit corporation has not filed a Statement of Information with the Secretary of State for a specified period of time. Prior to the administrative dissolution or administrative surrender of the nonprofit corporation, the bill would require either the Franchise Tax Board or the Secretary of State to provide notice to the nonprofit corporation of the pending administrative dissolution or administrative surrender. The bill would also require the Secretary of State to provide notice of the pending administrative dissolution or administrative surrender on its Internet Web site, as specified. The bill would authorize a nonprofit corporation to provide the Franchise Tax Board or the Secretary of State with a written objection to the administrative dissolution or administrative surrender. If there is no written objection or the written objection fails, the bill would require the nonprofit corporation to be administratively dissolved or administratively surrendered and would provide that the certificate of the Secretary of State is prima facie evidence of the administrative dissolution or administrative surrender. Upon administrative dissolution or administrative surrender, the bill would abate the nonprofit corporation's liabilities for qualified taxes, interest, and penalties, as provided.\n\n(3) Existing law, the Nonprofit Corporation Law, authorizes a nonprofit public benefit corporation, nonprofit mutual benefit corporation, and nonprofit religious corporation to elect voluntarily to wind up and dissolve by either approval of a majority of all members or approval of the board and approval of the members. Under existing law, the General Corporation Law, when a corporation has not issued shares, a majority of the directors, or, if no directors have been named in the articles or have been elected, the incorporator or a majority of the incorporators, are authorized to sign and verify a specified certificate of dissolution. Existing law requires the certificate to be filed with the Secretary of State and requires the Secretary of State to notify the Franchise Tax Board of the dissolution. Existing law provides that, upon the filing of the certificate, a corporation is dissolved and its powers, rights, and privileges cease.\n\nThis bill would enact provisions similar to those General Corporation Law provisions and make them applicable to nonprofit public benefit corporations, nonprofit mutual benefit corporations, and nonprofit religious corporations. The bill would additionally provide that liability to creditors, if any, is not discharged, the liability of the directors of the dissolved nonprofit corporation is not discharged, and the dissolution of a nonprofit corporation does not diminish or adversely affect the ability of the Attorney General to enforce specified liabilities.\n\n(4) Existing law requires every corporation doing business within the limits of this state and not expressly exempted from taxation to annually pay to the state, for the privilege of exercising its corporate franchises within this state, a tax according to or measured by its net income, as specified. Under existing law, every corporation, except as specified, is subject to the minimum franchise tax until the effective date of dissolution or withdrawal or, if later, the date the corporation ceases to do business within the limits of this state. Upon certification by the Secretary of State that a nonprofit public benefit corporation or a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation has failed to file the required Statement of Information, existing law requires the Franchise Tax Board to assess a specified penalty.\n\nThis bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to abate, upon written request by a qualified nonprofit corporation, as defined, unpaid qualified taxes, interest, and penalties, as defined, for the taxable years in which the nonprofit corporation certifies, under penalty of perjury, that it was not doing business, as defined. The bill would make this abatement conditioned on the dissolution of the qualified corporation within a specified period of time of filing the request for abatement. The bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to prescribe rules and regulations to carry out these abatement provisions and would exempt these rules and regulations from the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n(5) Existing state constitutional law prohibits the Legislature from making any gift, or authorizing the making of any gift, of any public money or thing of value to any individual, municipal, or other corporation.\n\nThis bill would make certain legislative findings and declarations that abatement of a nonprofit corporation's liabilities for specified taxes, penalties, and interest serves a statewide public purpose, as provided.\n\n(6) By expanding the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.", "scraped_subjects": ["Nonprofit corporations: abatement: dissolution: surrender."], "bill_id": "AB 557"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00015623"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [], "actor": "lower", "date": "2015-02-23 00:00:00", "+actor_info": {"details": "Assembly (Desk)"}, "action": "Read first time.

Existing law requires the board of governors to adopt regulations for the effective administration of the law concerning the appropriate percentage of hours of credit instruction taught by full-time instructors. Existing law requires the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to compute the number of full-time faculty required to be secured using program improvement allocations, as specified, to determine the extent to which each community college district has hired that number of full-time faculty, and, to the extent that the cumulative number of full-time faculty have not been retained, to reduce the district's base budget for 1991\u00e2\u20ac\u201c92 and subsequent fiscal years in accordance with a certain formula.\n\nThis bill would repeal the requirement to expend a portion of the program improvement allocation to increase the ratio of full-time to part-time faculty and, with respect to community college districts that have not reached the 75% standard referenced above, would require similar expenditures of Student Success and Support Program funds to increase that ratio, and to support part-time faculty.

The act requires a local agency or school district that initiates proceedings for a change of local government organization or reorganization, by submitting a resolution of application to a local agency formation commission, to also submit a plan for providing services within the affected territory, as specified.\n\nThis bill would, in the case of a disincorporation or reorganization that includes a disincorporation, require the plan for services to include specific provisions, including, among others, an enumeration and description of the services currently provided by the city proposed for disincorporation.\n\n(2) The act requires a petitioner or legislative body desiring to initiate proceedings to submit an application to the executive officer of the local agency formation commission, and requires the local agency formation commission, with regard to an application that includes an incorporation, to immediately notify all affected local agencies and any applicable state agency, as specified.\n\nThis bill would extend that requirement to an application that includes a disincorporation.\n\n(3) Existing law prohibits the commission from approving or conditionally approving a proposal for an incorporation unless the commission finds, among other things, that the proposal is consistent with the intent of the act, the incorporation is consistent with the spheres of influence of affected local agencies, and the proposed city is expected to receive revenues sufficient to provide public services and facilities and a reasonable reserve during the 3 fiscal years following incorporation.\n\nThis bill would additionally prohibit the commission from approving or conditionally approving a proposal that includes a disincorporation unless the commission finds, among other things, that the disincorporation is consistent with the intent of the act, the disincorporation will address necessary changes to spheres of influence of affected agencies, and the service responsibilities of the city proposed for disincorporation have been assigned, as specified.\n\n(4) Existing law requires the executive officer of the commission to prepare a comprehensive fiscal analysis for any proposal that includes an incorporation, as specified.\n\nThis bill would additionally require the executive officer to prepare a comprehensive fiscal analysis for any proposal that includes a disincorporation, as specified. \n\n(5) Existing law requires the commission to determine the amount of property tax revenue to be exchanged by the affected local agency for a proposal that includes the incorporation of a city, and sets forth the procedures to be followed in making that determination.\n\nThis bill would additionally require the commission to determine the amount of property tax revenue to be exchanged by the affected city and any successor agency or affected local agency for a proposal that includes a disincorporation of a city, and would set forth the procedures to be followed in making that determination.\n\nThe bill would additionally require the commission to determine, where the proposal includes the disincorporation of a city with the assignment of property tax revenues to a successor agency, the increase of the appropriations limit for the successor agency or agencies, if the successor agency or agencies are existing entities, or the appropriations limit for a new special district, as specified. \n\nThe bill would state the intent of the Legislature that a proposal that includes a disincorporation of a city result in a determination that the debt or contractual obligations and responsibilities of the city being disincorporated be the responsibility of the same territory for repayment. The bill would require the city being disincorporated to provide a written statement, prior to issuance of a certificate for filing for a proposal that includes a disincorporation, that includes specified information relating to its debts and contractual obligations.\n\n(6) Existing law authorizes the commission, in approving a disincorporation of a city, the dissolution of a district, or the reorganization or consolidation of agencies that result in the dissolution of one or more districts or disincorporation of one or more cities, to make the approval conditional upon the agency being dissolved not approving any increase in compensation or benefits for specified officers of the agency, or appropriating, encumbering, expending, or otherwise obligating any revenue of the agency beyond that provided in the current budget at the time the dissolution is approved by the commission, unless it first finds that an emergency exists.\n\nThis bill would modify this provision to authorize the commission to make the approval conditional upon a condition prohibiting the district that is being dissolved or the city that is being disincorporated from approving any increase in compensation or benefits for specified officers of the agency, or appropriating, encumbering, expending, or otherwise obligating any revenue of the agency beyond that provided in the current budget at the time the dissolution is approved by the commission, unless it first finds that an emergency exists.\n\nThe act also authorizes the commission to require a single question appearing on the ballot upon issues of annexation and reorganization in any election at which the questions of annexation and district reorganization or incorporation and district reorganization are to be considered at the same time. \n\nThis bill would additionally apply these provisions to a disincorporation and district reorganization.\n\n(7) Existing law requires every public officer of a city being disincorporated, prior to the effective date of the disincorporation, to turn the public property in his or her possession over to the board of supervisors.\n\nThis bill would repeal this provision. \n\n(8) The act requires the commission, after ascertaining that the disincorporation has carried, to determine and certify in a written statement to the board of supervisors the indebtedness of the city, the amount of money in its treasury, and the amount of any tax levy or other obligation due the city that is unpaid or has not been collected.\n\nThis bill would repeal this provision. \n\n(9) Existing law requires the board of supervisors to make specified determinations if the commission does not provide the board with a statement of those determinations.\n\nThis bill would repeal this provision.\n\n(10) Existing law requires the tax collector to collect any tax that has been levied by a disincorporated city that remains uncollected when due and pay it into the county treasury.\n\nThis bill would provide that the tax collected and paid into the county treasury is on behalf of the designated successor agency or county to wind up affairs of the disincorporated city.\n\n(11) Existing law requires the board of supervisors of a county to cause taxes to be levied and collected from within the territory formerly included within a disincorporated city, if there is not sufficient money in the treasury of a disincorporated city to the credit of the special fund to pay any city indebtedness as it becomes due. Existing law provides that any taxes levied pursuant to this provision are to be assessed, levied, and collected in the same manner and at the same time as other county taxes, and are additional taxes upon the property included within the territory of the disincorporated city.\n\nThis bill would repeal these provisions.\n\n(12) Existing law requires the board of supervisors to levy a special tax upon all property within the disincorporated city if the revenues from specified public utilities are not sufficient for the administration, conduct, or improvement of the public utility.\n\nThis bill would repeal this provision. \n\n(13) Existing law requires the board of supervisors to annually, at the time other county taxes are levied and collected, to levy and collect a special tax on the remainder of the territory of a disincorporated city sufficient to pay the balance of the debt, and pay that sum to the city treasurer.

Existing law requires any person who plans to conduct any excavation to contact the appropriate regional notification center before commencing that excavation, as specified. Existing law defines a subsurface installation as any underground pipeline, conduit, duct, wire, or other structure, except nonpressurized sewer lines, storm drains, or other drain lines. Existing law requires an operator of a subsurface installation, who receives notification of proposed excavation work, within 2 working days of that notification, excluding weekends and holidays, to mark the approximate location and number of subsurface installations that may be affected by the excavation or to advise that no subsurface installations operated by him or her would be affected.

The bill would also require, in any action for reimbursement or indemnification for a claim arising from damage to a subsurface installation in which the court or arbitrator finds that the excavator complied with those provisions, the excavator to be awarded reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.\n\nThe bill would delete the existing exemptions pertaining to an owner of real property and would instead exempt an owner of residential real property who only uses hand tools for excavation work not requiring a permit on his or her residential real property that has no easement or right of way.\n\nExisting law authorizes the Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board to adopt and to publish occupational safety and health standards.\n\nThis bill would require the board, on or before January 1, 2017, to revise these provisions to clarify best practices to be used by excavators when excavating near subsurface installations.

That law requires the commission to develop and implement an appeals process to govern issuance and appeal of citations, or resolution of corrective action orders. That law requires the commission to implement the safety enforcement program for gas safety by July 1, 2014, and for electrical safety by January 1, 2015.\n\nThis bill would require that moneys collected as a result of the issuance of citations to gas corporations and electrical corporations pursuant to the above-described law be deposited in the Safe Energy Infrastructure and Excavation Fund. \n\nThe bill would make other conforming changes.", "scraped_subjects": ["Protection of subsurface installations."], "bill_id": "SB 119"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00015124"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [{"type": "committee", "name": "Standing Committee on Rules", "id": "CAC000778"}], "actor": "upper", "date": "2015-01-29 00:00:00", "+actor_info": {"details": "Senate (Rules)"}, "action": "Introduced.

Under existing law, with certain exceptions, every individual, as a condition of eligibility for aid under the CalWORKs program, is required to participate in welfare-to-work activities. Existing law also provides that a parent or caretaker relative shall not be eligible for CalWORKs aid when he or she has received aid for a cumulative total of 48 months.

Existing law authorizes counties to participate in the CalFresh Employment and Training program (CalFresh E&T) , established by federal law, and requires participating counties to screen CalFresh work registrants to determine whether they will participate in, or be deferred from, the CalFresh E&T program.\n\nExisting federal law limits an able-bodied adult without dependents (ABAWD) participant to 3 months of CalFresh benefits in a 3-year period unless that participant has met specified work participation requirements. Existing law directs the State Department of Social Services to annually seek a federal waiver of this limitation, and provides that an eligible county is included in this waiver unless the county declines to participate in the waiver request. Existing law authorizes the department to implement this provision by all-county letters or similar instructions.\n\nThis bill would require all counties to participate in the CalFresh E&T program, and would direct each county to provide a placement in the program for every ABAWD that requests one. The bill would provide that federal funds for serving all at-risk ABAWDs through a CalFresh E&T program be used to support the cost to the county of providing these services using a formula established by the department in consultation with the county and the Food and Nutrition Service of the United States Department of Agriculture.

The bill would require that federal funds received to serve, through a CalFresh E&T program, ABAWDs who are subject to the time limitation be used to support the cost to the counties of providing these services using a formula established by the department in consultation with county human services agencies and the Food and Nutrition Service of the United States Department of Agriculture. The bill would also require those counties, if they send a notice of action to an applicant or participant subject to the ABAWD time limit, to include specified information to help the person, to the maximum extent permitted by federal law, to seek and receive assistance in securing employment or an exemption. By imposing these requirements on counties, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n The bill would also require the department to issue annual guidance to these counties regarding federal exemptions and waivers, and would authorize the department to implement the provisions of the bill by all-county letters or similar instructions and require the department to thereafter adopt regulations to implement its provisions by January 1, 2018.\n\n(3) Existing law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county costs under the CalWORKs program.\n\nThis bill would instead provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill. \n\n(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

Existing law requires the county board of education, as a condition of making a loan to a charter school, to report to the State Department of Education by September 15 of each year specified information on loans made to charter schools within the prior fiscal year, and requires the department to compile that information into one report to be submitted by December 1 of each year to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature, the Department of Finance, and the Legislative Analyst's Office.\n\nThis bill would instead require the California School Finance Authority within the State Treasurer's Office to compile the information referenced above into the one report to be submitted by December 1 of each year to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature, the Department of Finance, and the Legislative Analyst's Office.\n\n(2) Existing law establishes the K\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12 High-Speed Network, as specified, for the purpose of enriching pupil educational experiences and improving pupil academic performance by providing high\u00e2\u20ac\u2018speed, high\u00e2\u20ac\u2018bandwidth Internet connectivity to the public schools. Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to use a competitive grant process to select a local educational agency to serve as the Lead Education Agency to administer the network on behalf of the Superintendent. Existing law requires the Superintendent to establish a K\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12 HSN advisory board to include the Superintendent, the county superintendent of schools of the Lead Education Agency, the President of the State Board of Education, and other officers of local educational agencies, including 3 schoolsite representatives, as specified.\n\nThis bill would specify that the schoolsite representatives appointed to the advisory board under this provision would serve renewable 2-year terms.\n\n(3) Existing law authorizes the State Allocation Board to allocate any amount of the funds designated for purposes of school housing aid for school districts impacted by seasonal agricultural employment that is in excess of the amounts needed for administration to any of specified funds, including the State School Deferred Maintenance Fund, as provided. Existing law separately authorizes the board to transfer any funds within the State School Building Aid Fund that are in excess of the amounts needed by the board for the maintenance of portable buildings or for the purchase of new portable buildings, for that fiscal year, to any of specified funds, including the State School Deferred Maintenance Fund, as provided.\n\nThis bill would delete those allocation authorizations to the State School Deferred Maintenance Fund.\n\n(4) Existing law, the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act of 1998 (the Greene Act of 1998) , requires the State Allocation Board to allocate to applicant school districts and county offices of education prescribed per-unhoused-pupil state funding for construction and modernization of school facilities, including hardship funding, and supplemental funding for site development and acquisition. Existing law requires the board to require school districts and county offices of education that receive funding under the Greene Act of 1998 to establish a restricted account within the school district's or county office of education's general fund and to deposit, in each fiscal year for 20 years, a minimum amount equal to or greater than 3% of the school district's or county office of education's total general fund expenditures, including other financing uses, for that fiscal year into the account for maintenance of school facilities. Existing law authorizes annual deposits into the account in excess of 212% of the school district's general fund budget to count towards the amount that a school district is required to contribute in order to receive an apportionment from the State School Deferred Maintenance Fund.\n\nThis bill would delete that authorization.\n\n(5) Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district to establish a restricted fund known as the \"district deferred maintenance fund\" for certain school facilities purposes, including, among others, any other items of maintenance approved by the State Allocation Board.\n\nThis bill would remove that purpose from the list of specifically authorized purposes, but would no longer limit the use of the fund to the list of specifically authorized purposes.\n\n(6) Existing law, the Carl Washington School Safety and Violence Prevention Act, among other things, effectuates the intent of the Legislature that public schools serving pupils in any of grades 8 to 12, inclusive, have access to supplemental resources to establish programs and strategies that promote school safety and emphasize violence prevention among children and youth in public schools. A provision of this act requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to annually report to the Legislature regarding the use of funds pursuant to the act, and to base this report on information provided to the Superintendent by local educational agencies.\n\nThis bill would delete this provision.\n\n(7) Existing law, the School Safety Violence Protection Act, effectuates the intent of the Legislature that all public schools with any combination of instructional settings from kindergarten to grade 7, inclusive, have access to supplemental resources to establish programs and strategies that promote school safety and emphasize violence prevention among children and youth in the public schools. A provision of this act requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction and the Attorney General to cooperatively design an evaluation process for the programs and activities established pursuant to the act and report to the Legislature by January 1 of each year, as specified.\n\nThis bill would delete this provision.\n\n(8) Existing law requires the State Department of Education, and authorizes the Compton Unified School District, to identify low-performing schools in the school district, as provided, for purposes of providing extended school year instruction. Former law, repealed by its own provisions on January 1, 2003, authorized the Compton Unified School District to receive funding for extended year classes at those low-performing schools in the school district, as provided. Existing law requires the department, in conjunction with the Legislative Analyst, to contract for 2 independent evaluations, as provided, to determine the effectiveness of the extended school year curriculum, instructional program, and materials in improving pupil academic outcomes at those low-performing schools in the Compton Unified School District. Existing law requires the results of the evaluations to be reported on or before January 1, 2002, and January 1, 2003, respectively, to specified persons.\n\nThis bill would delete those obsolete provisions.\n\n(9) Existing law, the Chacon-Moscone Bilingual-Bicultural Education Act of 1976, which ceased to be operative on June 30, 1987, required, among other things, that the Superintendent of Public Instruction report annually to the Legislature on bilingual education programs, as specified. The act also required the State Department of Education to prepare and submit to the Legislature an annual report regarding the number of participants in the State Bilingual Teacher Training Assistance Program and other topics related to that program.\n\nThis bill would delete those reporting requirements.\n\n(10) Existing law establishes programs to provide state aid to public schools where pupil performance is affected by factors such as low family income, high pupil transiency rates, and large numbers of homes where a primary language other than English is spoken. Existing law requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to submit annually to the Governor and to each house of the Legislature a report evaluating these programs and containing information related to specified topics.\n\nThis bill would delete the requirement for this annual report.\n\n(11) This bill would also update references, delete other obsolete provisions, make conforming changes, and make other nonsubstantive changes.", "scraped_subjects": ["Education: omnibus bill."], "bill_id": "SB 436"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00015961"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [{"type": "committee", "name": "Standing Committee on Rules", "id": "CAC000778"}], "actor": "upper", "date": "2015-02-25 00:00:00", "+actor_info": {"details": "Senate (Rules)"}, "action": "Introduced.

The bill would also require that if the CalFresh recipient complies with the requirement during the notice of adverse action period and has registered for work with the Employment Development Department, the proposed penalty would be canceled and would not count as an occurrence for the purposes of determining the length of future CalFresh disqualification periods.

Existing law imposes limits on the amount of income and personal and real property an individual or family may possess in order to be eligible for CalWORKs aid.\n\nThis bill would exempt from consideration as income or property, for purposes of determining eligibility or available income or property, education, training, vocation, or rehabilitation benefits provided through the United States Department of Veterans Affairs for active duty personnel, veterans, and dependents, or spouses of those who died in the line of duty or have a service-connected disability. By expanding eligibility for CalWORKs, which is administered by counties, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law requires a recipient of CalWORKs to participate in welfare-to-work activities as a condition of eligibility. Under existing law, a person may meet his or her welfare-to-work requirements by taking part in a self-initiated education or training program if he or she is making satisfactory progress in that program, the county determines that continuing in the program is likely to lead to self-supporting employment for that recipient, and the welfare-to-work plan reflects that determination. Existing law requires the county and local educational agencies to annually agree to a list of educational programs that lead to employment.\n\nExisting law limits the time period in which a participant may engage in certain educational activities, in satisfaction of welfare-to-work requirements, to 24 cumulative months during a participant's lifetime, and requires the participant to engage in federally defined work activities after that period expires. Existing law requires that necessary supportive services be available to every welfare-to-work participant in order to participate in the program activity to which he or she is assigned. \n\nThis bill would exempt a person who is participating in a self-initiated education and training program from the requirement that the person participate in job search activities. The bill would also exempt hours of participation in a self-initiated program from the 24-month time limitation described above and would make related, conforming changes. The bill would authorize study time, as defined by the educational institution, to be counted toward the participant's minimum work participation hours requirements. The bill would require that supportive services be provided to a person participating in a self-initiated program until an assessment has been completed, if an assessment is found to be necessary. The bill would require that childcare supportive services be continued during a period in which a participant's hours of participation in educational or vocational training are reduced due to a break in instruction at the institution lasting no more than 6 weeks, if the person is eligible to continue in the educational or vocational program following the break in instruction. The bill would also require the county to annually approve a list of programs identified by the county or local educational agencies or providers as leading to employment. By imposing these duties on counties, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law continuously appropriates moneys from the General Fund to defray a portion of county costs under the CalWORKs program.\n\nThis bill would instead provide that the continuous appropriation would not be made for purposes of implementing the bill.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

The bill would also make conforming changes.\n\n(2) Existing law requires, if the number of pupils who wish to attend a charter school exceeds its capacity, preference to be extended to pupils currently attending the charter school and to pupils who reside in the school district, and authorizes other preferences as permitted by the chartering authority on an individual school basis and only if consistent with the law. Existing law prohibits the governing board of a school district from denying a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless the governing board of the school district finds that the petition does not contain specified information, including reasonably comprehensive descriptions of certain things, including admission requirements, if applicable.\n\nThis bill would additionally require preference for siblings of pupils attending the charter school and children of employees at the charter school, but would delete the authorization for a chartering authority to permit other preferences.

By imposing additional duties on school districts, and to the extent this would impose additional duties on charter school officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

As part of that process, the Charter Schools Act requires, no later than 30 days after receiving a petition, the governing board of a school district to hold a public hearing on the provisions of the charter, at which time the governing board of the school district is required to consider the level of support for the petition by teachers employed by the school district, other employees of the school district, and parents.\n\nThis bill would require the governing board of a school district to also consider a report assessing whether school district staff has the capacity to conduct oversight of the charter school described in the petition and a report of the anticipated financial and educational impact on the other schools that the governing board of the school district has oversight obligations for. By imposing additional duties on school district officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(2) The Charter Schools Act prohibits the governing board of a school district from denying a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings, specific to the particular petition, to support one or more specific findings, including, among others, that the petition lacks the requisite number of signatures or that the charter school presents an unsound educational program. If the governing board of the school district denies the petition, the Charter Schools Act authorizes the petitioners to elect to submit the petition to the county board of education, and if the county board of education denies the petition, to submit the petition to the State Board of Education, and requires the county board of education and the state board to review the petition pursuant to the provisions applicable to the governing board of a school district.\n\nThis bill would add having a negative fiscal impact on the school district to the list of specific findings sufficient to authorize the governing board of a school district to deny a petition, as provided.\n\n(3) The Charter Schools Act specifies a separate petition process for the establishment of a countywide charter school. As part of that separate process, the Charter Schools Act requires, no later than 60 days after receiving a petition, a county board of education to hold a public hearing on the provisions of the charter, at which time the county board of education is required to consider the level of support for the petition by teachers, parents or guardians, and the school districts where the charter school petitioner proposes to place school facilities.\n\nThis bill would require a county board of education to also consider a report assessing whether county office of education staff has the capacity to conduct oversight of the charter school described in the petition and a report of the anticipated financial and educational impact on the other schools that the governing board of a school district has oversight obligations for. By imposing additional duties on county boards of education, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(4) The Charter Schools Act requires a county board of education to deny a petition for the establishment of a countywide charter school if it makes certain findings, including, among others, that the petition lacks the requisite number of signatures or that the charter school presents an unsound educational program. The Charter Schools Act also specifies a separate petition process for the establishment of a state charter school whereby the petition is submitted directly to the State Board of Education, and authorizes the state board to deny a petition for any of the reasons that require a county board of education to deny a petition.\n\nThis bill would require a county board of education to, and would thus authorize the state board to, deny a petition if it finds that the charter school would have a negative financial impact on a school district, as provided. To the extent this bill would impose additional duties on a county board of education, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(5) Existing law, the Local Agency Public Construction Act (the act) , sets forth the requirements for competitive bidding on various types of contracts awarded by state and local agencies, including a school district. The act requires, among other things, the governing board of a school district to let contracts for the purchase of equipment, materials, or supplies to be furnished, leased, or sold to the school district, services other than construction services, and certain repairs, involving an expenditure of more than $50,000, and to let contracts for public projects, as defined, involving an expenditure of $15,000 or more, to the lowest responsible bidder who gives security as the governing board of the school district requires.\n\nThis bill would apply the provisions of the act applicable to school districts to charter schools. By imposing additional duties on charter school officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(6) This bill also would update references and make other nonsubstantive changes.\n\n(7) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

Existing law requires the governing board of each school district to establish standards of expected pupil achievement at each grade level in each area of study and to evaluate and assess certificated employee performance on a continuing basis as it reasonably relates to the progress of pupils toward the established standards and, if applicable, the state adopted academic content standards as measured by state adopted criterion referenced assessments, the instructional techniques and strategies used by the employee, the employee's adherence to curricular objectives, and the establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment, within the scope of the employee's responsibilities.\n\nThis bill would provide that the provisions described above would become inoperative on July 1, 2016. The bill would state findings and declarations of the Legislature regarding the nature of effective teachers and of the teaching profession. Commencing on July 1, 2016, the bill would require the governing board of each school district to adopt and implement a locally negotiated best practices teacher evaluation system, described as one in which each teacher is evaluated on a continuing basis on the degree to which he or she accomplishes specific objectives and multiple observations of instructional and other professional practices that are conducted by trained evaluators. The bill would authorize the State Board of Education, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Instruction and appropriate education stakeholder groups, to adopt nonregulatory guidance to support the implementation of a best practices teacher evaluation system by school districts, as specified. The bill would also require the governing board of each school district to establish and define job responsibilities for certificated, noninstructional employees whose responsibilities cannot be evaluated appropriately under the best practices teacher evaluation system and to evaluate and assess their performance in relation to the fulfillment of those responsibilities. The bill would, on or before May 1, 2016, or May 1 of the year that precedes the year in which an existing collective bargaining contract will expire, whichever is later, require the governing board of each school district, at a regularly scheduled public hearing, to seek comment on the development and implementation of the best practices teacher evaluation system, and, on or before May 1 of each year before local negotiations required by law, to seek comment on the best practices teacher evaluation system. The bill would require if, by mutual agreement between the school district and the collective bargaining unit, an intermediate mid-year agreement is reached regarding a best practices teacher evaluation system, the negotiation timeline to allow time for the governing board of the school district to hold a public hearing to seek comment on the best practices teacher evaluation system. The bill also would require the governing board of each school district to disclose the provisions of the best practices teacher evaluation system at a regularly scheduled public hearing. The bill would provide that these provisions do not apply to certificated personnel who are employed on an hourly basis in adult education classes. The bill would also provide that the provisions of the best practices teacher evaluation system do not supersede or invalidate a teacher evaluation system that is locally negotiated and that is in effect at the time the best practices teacher evaluation system becomes operative. By imposing additional duties on school districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would appropriate, for the 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u201c17 fiscal year, an unspecified amount of money from the General Fund to the State Department of Education for allocation to school districts for the purpose of implementing the best practices teachers evaluation system, as specified, thereby making an appropriation.\n\n(2) Existing law requires that an evaluation and assessment of the performance of a certificated employee be made on a continuing basis, as provided, including at least every 5 years for personnel with permanent status who have been employed at least 10 years with the school district, are highly qualified, as specified, and whose previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards, if the evaluator and certificated employee being evaluated agree.\n\nThis bill, commencing July 1, 2016, would require the evaluation and assessment of the above personnel at least every 3 years, except as locally negotiated and provided in the best practices teacher evaluation system. By requiring additional duties on school districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(3) Existing law authorizes a school district to evaluate a school principal annually for the principal's first and 2nd year of employment as a new principal and authorizes additional evaluations, as specified.\n\nThis bill would repeal those provisions and would instead require the governing board of each school district to establish a system of evaluation for school administrators to guide their growth and performance with the purpose of supporting them as instructional leaders in order to raise pupil achievement. The bill would require the evaluation system to include certain attributes, including, but not limited to, promoting the success of all pupils, advocating and supporting a safe, nurturing school culture that sustains a quality instructional program conducive to pupil learning and staff professional growth, and ensuring the management, organization, and operation of a safe and successful learning environment as evidenced by the establishment of effective practices for personnel and resource management, campus safety, and school climate. The bill would require the governing board of a school district to identify who will conduct the evaluation of each school administrator. By imposing additional duties on school district officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(4) Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district or a county board of education, as specified, after a public hearing on the matter, to request the state board to waive all or part of any section of the Education Code or any regulation adopted by the state board that implements a provision of the Education Code that may be waived, except for specified provisions.\n\nThis bill would add the above-mentioned provisions relating to teacher and school administrator evaluation to the list of provisions that may not be waived.\n\n(5) This bill would update cross-references and would make other nonsubstantive changes.\n\n(6) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.\n\n(7) Funds appropriated by this bill would be applied toward the minimum funding requirements for school districts and community college districts imposed by Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.", "scraped_subjects": ["Teachers: best practices teacher evaluation system: school administrator evaluation."], "bill_id": "SB 499"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00016137"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [{"type": "committee", "name": "Standing Committee on Rules", "id": "CAC000778"}], "actor": "upper", "date": "2015-02-26 00:00:00", "+actor_info": {"details": "Senate (Rules)"}, "action": "Introduced.

Existing law authorizes certain foster children living in emergency shelters to receive educational services at the emergency shelter as necessary for short periods of time for specified reasons. Existing law requires that all educational and school placement decisions be based on the best interests of the child.\n\nThis bill would specify that the short period of time described above not exceed 5 schooldays. The bill would specify that all educational and school placement decisions are required to be based on the best interests of the child as determined by the parent or guardian, or other person holding the right to make educational decisions for the pupil. The bill would authorize the filing of a complaint of noncompliance with these provisions to be filed with the local educational agency under the Uniform Complaint Procedures set forth in the California Code of Regulations, except as otherwise specified. The bill would require compensatory educational services to be awarded to a pupil if a decision of either the local educational agency or the State Department of Education determines that the local educational agency has violated a pupil's right to remain in his or her school of origin pending resolution of a dispute regarding school placement, as specified. The bill would also require information regarding the requirements of these provisions relating to educational and school placements of certain foster youth to be included in a specified annual notification. By imposing additional requirements on local educational agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(2) Existing law requires each local educational agency, as defined, to designate a staff person as the educational liaison for foster children, as defined. Existing law requires the educational liaison to ensure and facilitate the proper educational placement, enrollment in school, and checkout from school of foster children, and to assist foster children when transferring from one school to another school or from one school district to another school district in ensuring the proper transfer of credits, records, and grades.\n\nThis bill would authorize the filing of a complaint of noncompliance with these provisions to be filed with the local educational agency under the Uniform Complaint Procedures set forth in the California Code of Regulations, except as otherwise specified. The bill would require compensatory educational services to be awarded to a pupil if a decision of either the local educational agency or the State Department of Education determines that the local educational agency has violated a pupil's right to immediate enrollment or a pupil's right to remain in his or her school of origin pending resolution of a dispute regarding the request of a foster child to remain in the school of origin, as specified. The bill would also require information regarding the requirements of these provisions relating to educational and school placements of certain foster youth to be included in a specified annual notification. By imposing additional requirements on local educational agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(3) Existing law establishes procedures for the transfer of pupils in foster care between schools and, among other things, requires the local educational agency from which the pupil is transferring to compile the complete educational record of the pupil, including, among other things, full or partial credits earned and current classes and grades, and to deliver the educational information and records of the pupil to the next educational placement.\n\nThis bill would authorize the filing of a complaint of noncompliance with these provisions to be filed with the local educational agency under the Uniform Complaint Procedures set forth in the California Code of Regulations. The bill would also require information regarding the requirements of these provisions relating to the transfer of pupils in foster care between schools to be included in a specified annual notification. By imposing additional requirements on local educational agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(4) Existing law requires a school district, except as provided, to exempt a pupil in foster care, as defined, or a pupil who is a homeless child or youth, as defined, who transfers between schools any time after the completion of the pupil's 2nd year of high school from all coursework and other requirements adopted by the governing board of the school district that are in addition to certain statewide coursework requirements. Existing law requires the school district to notify specified individuals, including a pupil in foster care or a pupil who is a homeless child or youth, within 30 calendar days of the date that the pupil who may qualify for the exemption from local graduation requirements transfers into a school, that the pupil qualifies for that exemption.\n\nThis bill would authorize the filing of a complaint of noncompliance with these provisions to be filed with the local educational agency under the Uniform Complaint Procedures set forth in the California Code of Regulations, except as otherwise specified. The bill would also require information regarding the requirements of these provisions relating to exempting certain pupils from specified coursework to be included in a specified annual notification. By imposing additional requirements on local educational agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(5) Existing law requires a school district and county office of education to accept coursework satisfactorily completed by a pupil in foster care or a pupil who is a homeless child while attending another public school, a juvenile court school, or a nonpublic, nonsectarian school or agency even if the pupil did not complete the entire course and requires the school district and county office of education to issue the pupil full or partial credit for the coursework completed. Existing law requires those credits accepted to be applied to the same or equivalent course, if applicable, as the coursework completed in the prior public school, juvenile court school, or nonpublic, nonsectarian school or agency.\n\nThis bill would authorize the filing of a complaint of noncompliance with these provisions to be filed with the local educational agency under the Uniform Complaint Procedures set forth in the California Code of Regulations. The bill would also require information regarding the requirements of these provisions relating to the requirement that local educational agencies accept coursework satisfactorily completed by certain pupils, as specified, to be included in a specified annual notification. By imposing additional requirements on local educational agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(6) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.", "scraped_subjects": ["Foster youth: complaint of noncompliance."], "bill_id": "AB 379"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00015434"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [], "actor": "lower", "date": "2015-02-18 00:00:00", "+actor_info": {"details": "Assembly (Desk)"}, "action": "Read first time.

Existing law requires the governing board of each school district to establish standards of expected pupil achievement at each grade level in each area of study and to evaluate and assess certificated employee performance on a continuing basis as it reasonably relates to the progress of pupils toward the established standards and, if applicable, the state adopted academic content standards as measured by state adopted criterion referenced assessments, the instructional techniques and strategies used by the employee, the employee's adherence to curricular objectives, and the establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment, within the scope of the employee's responsibilities.\n\nThis bill would provide that the provisions described above would become inoperative on July 1, 2018. The bill would state findings and declarations of the Legislature regarding the nature of effective teachers and of the teaching profession. Commencing on July 1, 2018, the bill would require the governing board of each school district and the governing body of each charter school to adopt and implement a locally negotiated best practices teacher evaluation system, described as one in which each teacher is evaluated on a continuing basis on the degree to which he or she accomplishes specific objectives and multiple observations of instructional and other professional practices that are conducted by trained evaluators. The bill would authorize the State Board of Education, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Instruction and appropriate education stakeholder groups, to adopt nonregulatory guidance to support the implementation of a best practices teacher evaluation system by school districts and charter schools, as specified. The bill would, on or before May 1, 2016, or May 1 of the year that precedes the year in which an existing collective bargaining contract will expire, whichever is later, require the governing board of each school district and the governing body of each charter school, at a regularly scheduled public hearing, to seek comment on the development and implementation of the best practices teacher evaluation system, and, on or before May 1 of each year before local negotiations required by law, to seek comment on the best practices teacher evaluation system. The bill would require if, by mutual agreement between the school district or charter school and the collective bargaining unit, an intermediate mid-year agreement is reached regarding a best practices teacher evaluation system, the negotiation timeline to allow time for the governing board of the school district or the governing body of the charter school to hold a public hearing to seek comment on the best practices teacher evaluation system. The bill also would require the governing board of each school district and the governing body of each charter school to disclose the provisions of the best practices teacher evaluation system at a regularly scheduled public hearing. The bill would also require the governing board of each school district and the governing body of each charter school to establish and define job responsibilities for certificated, noninstructional employees and evaluate and assess their performance in relation to those responsibilities. The bill would provide that these provisions do not apply to certificated personnel who are employed on an hourly basis in adult education classes. The bill would also provide that the provisions of the best practices teacher evaluation system do not supersede or invalidate a teacher evaluation system that is locally negotiated and that is in effect at the time the best practices teacher evaluation system becomes operative.\n\n(2) Existing law requires that an evaluation and assessment of the performance of a certificated employee be made on a continuing basis, as provided, including at least every 5 years for personnel with permanent status who have been employed at least 10 years with the school district, are highly qualified, as specified, and whose previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards, if the evaluator and certificated employee being evaluated agree.\n\nThis bill, commencing July 1, 2018, would require the evaluation and assessment of the above personnel at least every 3 years, except as locally negotiated and provided in the best practices teacher evaluation system. The bill would also require charter schools to comply with these provisions.\n\n(3) Existing law authorizes a school district to evaluate a principal annually for the principal's first and 2nd year of employment as a new principal and authorizes additional evaluations, as specified.\n\nThis bill would repeal those provisions and would instead require the governing board of each school district to establish a system of evaluation for school administrators to guide their growth and performance with the purpose of supporting them as instructional leaders in order to raise pupil achievement. The bill would require the evaluation system to include certain attributes, including, but not limited to, promoting the success of all pupils, advocating and supporting a safe, nurturing school culture that sustains a quality instructional program conducive to pupil learning and staff professional growth, and ensuring the management, organization, and operation of a safe and successful learning environment as evidenced by the establishment of effective practices for personnel and resource management, campus safety, and school climate. The bill would require the governing board of a school district to identify who will conduct the evaluation of each school administrator. By imposing additional duties on school district officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(4) Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district or a county board of education, as specified, after a public hearing on the matter, to request the state board to waive all or part of any section of the Education Code or any regulation adopted by the state board that implements a provision of the Education Code that may be waived, except for specified provisions.\n\nThis bill would add the above-mentioned provisions relating to teacher and administrator evaluation to the list of provisions that may not be waived.\n\n(5) This bill also would state the intent of the Legislature to provide adequate resources to train evaluators, continue robust beginning teacher induction programs, and support struggling educators.\n\n(6) Under the California Constitution, whenever the Legislature or a state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government, including a school district and a community college district, the state is required to provide a subvention of funds to reimburse the local government, with specified exceptions. Existing law requires certain funds appropriated in the annual Budget Act for reimbursement of the cost of a new program or increased level of service of an existing program mandated by statute or executive order to be available as a block grant to school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to support specified state-mandated local programs and permits those entities to elect to receive that block grant funding in lieu of claiming mandated costs pursuant to the state claims process.\n\nThis bill would, as of July 1, 2018, add the best practices teacher evaluation system to the state-mandated local programs supported by the block grant funding.\n\n(7) This bill would update cross-references and would make other nonsubstantive changes.\n\n(8) By requiring school districts and charter schools to perform additional duties, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.", "chamber": "lower", "bill_id": "AB 575"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00015792"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [], "actor": "lower", "date": "2015-02-24 00:00:00", "+actor_info": {"details": "Assembly (Desk)"}, "action": "Read first time.

As part of that process, existing law requires a county committee on school district organization to hold a public hearing upon receipt of a petition signed by at least 10% of the qualified electors residing in any school district for consideration of unification or other reorganization of any area. Existing law also requires a county committee on school district organization to hold a public hearing upon receipt of a resolution approved by a majority of the members of specified local agencies for consideration of unification or other reorganization of any area. Following those public hearings, existing law requires the county committee on school district organization to grant or deny the petition or resolution proposal. If a county committee on school district organization approves a petition to transfer territory, existing law requires the county committee to notify the county superintendent of schools who, upon that notification, is required to call an election in the territory of the school district, as specified. \n\nNotwithstanding those provisions, this bill would create a separate procedure for inhabited territory transfers within the boundaries of a single school district for the formation of a new school district within a single county. The bill would authorize a transfer to be initiated by a petition signed by 10% of the number of qualified electors who voted in the last gubernatorial election and who reside within the boundaries of the proposed district, or by resolution of a local agency, as defined, approved by a majority of its members.\n\nThe bill would require the county board of education to hold a public hearing on a petition upon receipt of that petition, and to grant or deny the petition following the hearing. The bill would also require the county board of education, upon receipt of a resolution proposal, to hold a public hearing on that proposal jointly with the local agency that initiated the proposed transfer, and would require the county board of education and the local agency to jointly grant or deny the proposal by majority vote of all members. By imposing additional duties on county boards of education, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe bill would require a petition to identify the persons who will represent the proposed school district at those public hearings. The bill would also require the local agency to appoint persons to represent the proposed school district at those public hearings by a resolution.\n\nThe bill would require the county superintendent of schools to call an election of registered voters within the boundaries of the territory to be transferred, as specified, if a petition or proposal is granted. By imposing additional duties on county superintendents of schools, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(2) The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) generally requires all state and local governmental lead agencies to prepare, or cause to be prepared by contract, and certify the completion of, an environmental impact report on any project that they propose to carry out or approve that may result in a significant effect on the environment, that is, a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the physical conditions that exist within the area that will be affected by the project.\n\nThis bill would provide that CEQA shall not apply to inhabited territory transfers within the boundaries of a single school district for the formation of a new school district within a single county where only existing facilities will be transferred.\n\n(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.", "chamber": "lower", "bill_id": "AB 803"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00016087"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [], "actor": "lower", "date": "2015-02-26 00:00:00", "+actor_info": {"details": "Assembly (Desk)"}, "action": "Read first time.

STRS is governed by the Teachers' Retirement Board. Existing law defines credited service for these purposes as service from which required contributions have been paid. Existing law permits the board to amend the plan to dispense with payment for amounts less than $10. Existing law permits specified employers participating in STRS, if it is in the best interests of the school district or office of education, to grant an additional 2 years of service credit in order to encourage retirement, if specified conditions are met.

Existing law defines a participant for these purposes and prescribes the circumstances pursuant to which a person is permitted to participate in the program and how participation may be terminated and service be subject to the Defined Benefit Program offered by STRS.

The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid provisions. Existing law provides that federally qualified health center (FQHC) services and rural health clinic (RHC) services, as defined, are covered benefits under the Medi-Cal program to be reimbursed, to the extent that federal financial participation is obtained, to providers on a per-visit basis.\n\nExisting law authorizes an FQHC or RHC to apply for an adjustment to its per-visit rate, based on a change in the scope of services provided, as prescribed. Existing law establishes alternative ratesetting procedures with respect to a new entity that first qualifies as an FQHC or RHC in the year 2001 or later, a newly licensed facility at a new location added to an existing FQHC or RHC or an existing FQHC or RHC that is relocated. Two of the procedures are referred to as comparability approaches, based on the rates of 3 similarly situated FQHCs and RHCs. The 3rd procedure requires, at a new entity's one-time election, that the department establish the reimbursement rate, calculated on a per-visit basis, that equals 100% of the projected allowable costs to the FQHC or RHC of furnishing services during its first 12 months of operation as an FQHC or RHC.\n\nThis bill would require the department to finalize a new rate within 90 days after an FQHC's or RHC's submission of a scope-of-service rate change. With respect to a new FQHC or RHC that has elected for the department to establish its reimbursement rate based on projected allowable costs as described above, this bill would require the department to finalize that rate within 90 days after the submission of the actual cost report from the first full 12 months of operation, as specified.\n\nThis bill would revise the department's responsibilities with respect to a new entity or a relocated FQHC or RHC that selects either of the comparability approaches. The bill would require the department to review the comparable facilities to determine if any of them do not meet the comparability threshold and, if so, to notify the new entity, and request a supplemental submission, as prescribed. The bill would require the department to conduct an initial review of a scope-of-service rate change request within 30 days after submission by the FQHC or RHC, and notify the FQHC or RHC by the 31st day after submission if the department determines that additional information is necessary, as prescribed. The bill would require the department to finalize the FQHC's or RHC's rate within 90 days after receiving a submission the department determines to be complete.\n\nThis bill would require the department to correct erroneous payments at least quarterly to reprocess past claims and ensure all claims are reimbursed at the appropriate finalized new rate.\n\nExisting law requires the department to administer a program to ensure that total payments to FQHCs and RHCs operating as managed care subcontractors comply with applicable federal law regarding payment for services provided by FQHCs and RHCs. Under the department's program, existing law requires FQHCs and RHCs subcontracting with specified managed care plans to seek supplemental reimbursement from the department through a per visit fee-for-service billing system. To be reimbursed under these provisions, existing law requires each FQHC and RHC to submit to the department for approval a rate differential based on the FQHC's or RHC's reasonable cost or the prospective payment rate. Within 6 months of the end of the FQHC's or RHC's fiscal year, existing law requires, to the extent feasible, the department to perform an annual reconciliation to reasonable cost, and make payments to, or obtain recovery from, the FQHC or RHC.\n\nThis bill would impose various requirements on the department regarding the reconciliation process described above.

The bill would also require the county probation or welfare department to make a report to the appropriate law enforcement authority for entry into the National Crime Information Center database of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children within 24 hours of becoming aware that a child or youth who is receiving child welfare services and who is known or suspected to be the victim of sexual exploitation is missing or has been abducted. By increasing the duties of county probation and welfare departments, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(7) Existing law establishes the Adoption Assistance Program for the purpose of benefiting children residing in foster homes by providing the stability and security of permanent homes. Existing law requires that any savings realized from the change in federal funding for adoption assistance resulting from the enactment of the federal Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 be spent for the provision of foster care and adoption services.\n\nThis bill would require that at least 30% of that savings be spent on postadoption services, postguardianship services, and services to support and sustain positive permanent outcomes for children who might enter foster care, as specified.\n\n(8) The Kinship Guardianship Assistance Payments for Children (Kin-GAP) Program provides financial assistance to children who are eligible for foster care maintenance payments and are placed in legal guardianship with a relative. Under existing law, termination of the guardianship terminates eligibility for Kin-GAP, unless an alternate kinship guardian or coguardian is appointed, as provided.\n\nThis bill would instead provide that if a successor kinship guardian is appointed, the successor guardian is entitled to receive Kin-GAP on behalf of the child if the reason for the appointment is the death or incapacity of the kinship guardian and the successor guardian is named in the kinship guardianship assistance agreement.\n\n(9) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.", "scraped_subjects": ["Child welfare services."], "bill_id": "SB 794"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00017184"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [{"type": "committee", "name": "Standing Committee on Rules", "id": "CAC000778"}], "actor": "upper", "action": "Introduced.

A violation of the licensing provisions of the act is a misdemeanor. Existing law requires all civil engineering plans, calculations, specifications, and reports to be prepared by, or under the responsible charge of, a licensed civil engineer, as specified. Existing law requires all civil engineering plans, calculations, specifications, and reports for the construction of all public school structures to be prepared by, or under the responsible charge of, a licensed architect or a licensed civil engineer who is also licensed as a structural engineer. Existing law requires all civil engineering plans, calculations, specifications, and reports for the construction of all hospitals and other medical facilities having surgery and emergency treatment areas to be prepared by, or under the responsible charge of, a licensed civil engineer who is also licensed as a structural engineer.\n\nThis bill would repeal the requirements that all civil engineering plans and other specified documents for construction of public school structures be prepared by, or under the responsible charge of, a licensed architect or a licensed civil engineer who is also licensed as a structural engineer. The bill would also repeal the requirements that all civil engineering plans and other specified documents for construction of specified hospital and medical facilities be prepared by, or under the responsible charge of, a licensed civil engineer who is also licensed as a structural engineer.\n\n(4) The California Constitution provides that laborers of every class who have worked upon or have furnished material for a property have a lien upon that property for the value of the labor done and material furnished. The California Constitution requires the Legislature to provide, by law, for the speedy and efficient enforcement of those liens. Existing law requires specified structural pest control operators to provide notice regarding possible liens, as specified, to the owner of property prior to entering into a contract to provide work on that property. A violation of these provisions is a misdemeanor.\n\nThis bill would extend the notice requirements to all structural pest control operators.\n\n(5) Existing law requires a structural pest control operator to provide a report detailing the results of an inspection for wood destroying pests or organisms prior to commencing work on a contract or expressing an opinion regarding the presence or absence of wood destroying pests or organisms, to the Structural Pest Control Board, within the Department of Consumer Affairs, as specified. Existing law requires that the pest control operator deliver a copy of the report to the person requesting inspection, or designated agent, within 10 business days of the inspection. Existing law requires a pest control operator to deliver a copy of that report to the owner or the owner's agent within 10 working days of an inspection.\n\nThis bill would remove the requirement that the pest control operator provide the owner of the property or the owner's agent with a copy of the report, unless the owner was the person who requested the inspection.\n\n(6) Existing law creates the California Travel and Tourism Commission and provides for the membership and meetings of the commission.\n\nThis bill would specify that all meetings of the commission take place in California and would authorize commissioners to attend meetings of the commission by conference telephone or other technology, as specified.\n\n(7) Because this bill would expand the definition of a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

Existing law requires the training to have been obtained from an accredited or approved educational institution, a continuing education provider approved by the responsible board, or a course sponsored or offered by a professional association or a local, county, or state department of health or mental health for continuing education and approved by the responsible board.\n\nThis bill would require the responsible board to specify a continuing education provider for child abuse assessment and reporting coursework by regulation, and would permit the responsible board to approve or accept a sponsored or offered course.\n\n(2) Existing law relating to unlicensed activity enforcement lists specified provisions that require registration, licensure, certification, or other authorization in order to engage in certain businesses or professions regulated by the department and makes a violation of a listed provision an infraction punishable as prescribed.\n\nThis bill would include in those listed provisions an existing requirement for the registration of individuals as certified polysomnographic technologists, polysomnographic technicians, and polysomnographic trainees. By creating a new infraction, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(3) The Dental Practice Act provides for the licensure and regulation of dentists by the Dental Board of California. For purposes of the act, any reference to the Board of Dental Examiners is deemed a reference to the Dental Board of California.\n\nThis bill would delete certain existing references to the Board of Dental Examiners and, instead, refer to the Dental Board of California.\n\n(4) Existing law provides for the regulation of dental hygienists by the Dental Hygiene Committee of California, within the jurisdiction of the Dental Board of California. Existing law authorizes the committee, until January 1, 2010, to contract with the dental board to carry out any of specified provisions relating to the regulation of dental hygienists, and, on and after January 1, 2010, to contract with the dental board to perform investigations of applicants and licensees under those provisions. Existing law requires the committee to establish fees that relate to the licensing of a registered dental hygienist, subject to specified limitations, including fees for curriculum review and site evaluation for accreditation of educational programs.\n\nThis bill would require the Dental Hygiene Committee of California to create and maintain a central file of the names of licensees, to provide an individual historical record with information on acts of licensee misconduct and discipline. The bill would remove the limiting dates from the contracting provisions, thereby authorizing the committee to contract with the dental board to carry out any of specified provisions relating to the regulation of dental hygienists, including performing investigations of applicants and licensees. This bill, with regard to fees for accreditation of educational programs, would add a maximum fee for feasibility study review.\n\n(5) The Medical Practice Act provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians and surgeons by the Medical Board of California. Under existing law, the board issues a physician and surgeon's certificate to a licensed physician and surgeon. The act prohibits a person who fails to renew his or her license within 5 years after its expiration from renewing it, and prohibits the license from being reissued, reinstated, or restored thereafter, although the act authorizes a person to apply for and obtain a new license under specified circumstances.\n\nThis bill would recast that provision to prohibit renewal by a person who voluntarily cancels his or her license or who fails to renew it as described, and would authorize that person to apply for and obtain a license under those specified circumstances, without regard to reissuance, reinstatement, or restoration.\n\n(6) Existing law relating to research psychoanalysts authorizes certain students and graduates in psychoanalysis to engage in psychoanalysis under prescribed circumstances if they register with the Medical Board of California and present evidence of their student or graduate status. Existing law authorizes that board to suspend or revoke the exemption of those persons from licensure for unprofessional conduct for, among other things, repeated acts of clearly excessive prescribing, furnishing, dispensing, or administering of drugs or treatment, use of diagnostic procedures, or use of diagnostic or treatment facilities.\n\nThis bill would substitute, for those described bases for suspension or revocation of the exemption, the commission of any act of sexual abuse, misconduct, or relations with a patient, client, or customer.\n\n(7) The Physical Therapy Practice Act provides for the licensure, approval, and regulation of physical therapists and physical therapist assistants by the Physical Therapy Board of California. The act establishes education requirements for a physical therapist assistant, including subject matter instruction through a combination of didactic and clinical experiences, and requires the clinical experience to include at least 18 weeks of full-time experience with a variety of patients.\n\nThis bill would delete that 18-week full-time experience requirement for physical therapist assistant education.\n\n(8) The Nursing Practice Act provides for the licensure and regulation of nurse practitioners by the Board of Registered Nursing. The act, on and after January 1, 2008, requires an applicant for initial qualification or certification as a nurse practitioner under the act who has not been qualified or certified as a nurse practitioner to meet specified requirements. Certain provisions allow the board to find other persons in practice qualified to use the title of \"nurse practitioner.\"\n\nThis bill would delete those title provisions.\n\n(9) The Nursing Practice Act provides for a diversion program to identify and rehabilitate registered nurses whose competency may be impaired due to abuse of alcohol and other drugs, or due to mental illness.\n\nThis bill would instead refer to the program as an intervention program.\n\n(10) The Optometry Practice Act provides for the licensure and regulation of optometrists by the State Board of Optometry. The act prescribes license eligibility requirements, including, but not limited to, submitting proof that the person is licensed in good standing as of the date of application in every state where he or she holds a license, including compliance with continuing education requirements, submitting proof that the person has been in active practice in a state in which he or she is licensed for a total of at least 5,000 hours in 5 of the 7 consecutive years immediately preceding the date of his or her application, and has never had his or her license to practice optometry revoked or suspended. For purposes of those provisions, \"in good standing\" includes the requirement that the person have not been found mentally incompetent by a physician so that the person is unable to undertake the practice of optometry in a manner consistent with the safety of a patient or the public.\n\nThis bill would delete that active practice requirement and would require that the license never have been revoked or suspended in any state where the person holds a license. The bill, with regard to making such a finding of mental incompetence, would replace a finding by a physician with a finding by a licensed psychologist or licensed psychiatrist.\n\n(11) The Physician Assistant Practice Act requires the Physician Assistant Board to annually elect a chairperson and vice chairperson from among its members.\n\nThis bill would require the annual election of a president and vice president.\n\n(12) Existing law relating to veterinary medicine requires a veterinary assistant to obtain a controlled substance permit from the Veterinary Medical Board in order to administer a controlled substance, and authorizes the board to deny, revoke, or suspend the permit, after notice and hearing, for any of specified causes. Existing law authorizes the board to revoke or suspend a permit for the same.\n\nThis bill would, instead, authorize the board to suspend or revoke the controlled substance permit of a veterinary assistant, after notice and hearing, for any of specified causes, and to deny, revoke, or suspend a permit for the same.\n\n(13) The Acupuncture Licensure Act provides for the licensure and regulation of the practice of acupuncture by the Acupuncture Board. The act requires the board to issue a license to practice acupuncture to a person who meets prescribed requirements. The act requires, in the case of an applicant who has completed education and training outside the United States and Canada, documented educational training and clinical experience that meets certain standards established by the board. Existing law, commencing January 1, 2017, specifically requires the board to establish standards for the approval of educational training and clinical experience received outside the United States and Canada.\n\nThis bill would remove Canada from those provisions, thereby applying the same standards to all training and clinical experience completed outside the United States.\n\n(14) The Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Act provides for the licensure and regulation of marriage and family therapists by the Board of Behavioral Sciences. The act sets forth the educational and training requirements for licensure as a marriage and family therapist, including certain supervised-experience requirements whereby a prospective licensee is required to work a specified number of hours in a clinical setting under the supervision of experienced professionals. The act requires all persons to register with the board as an intern in order to be credited for postdegree hours of supervised experience gained toward licensure. The act, with regard to interns, requires all postdegree hours of experience to be credited toward licensure, except when employed in a private practice setting, if certain conditions are met.\n\nThis bill would require postdegree hours of experience to be credited toward licensure if certain conditions are met. The bill would prohibit an applicant for licensure as a marriage and family therapist from being employed or volunteering in a private practice until registered as an intern by the board. This bill would similarly prohibit an applicant for professional clinical counselor under the Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Act from being employed or volunteering in a private practice until registered as an intern by the board.\n\n(15) The Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Act, the Educational Psychologist Practice Act, the Clinical Social Worker Practice Act, and the Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Act require the Board of Behavioral Sciences to approve continuing education providers for specified educational courses relating to licensure for marriage and family therapists, educational psychologists, clinical social workers, and professional clinical counselors.\n\nThe bill would modify those acts to require the Board of Behavioral Sciences to identify, by regulation, acceptable continuing education providers.\n\n(16) The Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Act and the Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor Act provide for the registration of interns and allow a maximum of possible renewals after initial registration, after which a new registration number is required to be obtained. The Clinical Social Worker Practice Act provides similarly for the registration and renewal of registration of associate clinical social workers. An applicant who is issued a subsequent number is barred from employment or volunteering in a private practice.\n\nThis bill would revise those provisions to refer throughout to subsequent registration numbers.\n\n(17) This bill would additionally delete or update obsolete provisions and make conforming or nonsubstantive changes.\n\n(18) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

The membership of the task force would include members of the Legislature, as well as representatives of specified agencies, departments, and private entities. The bill would set forth the initial and ongoing responsibilities of the task force, including, among others, an assessment of state program alignment with the objectives of the My Brother's Keeper program and the Assembly Select Committee on the Status of Boys and Men of Color in California, and the development of strategies to enhance positive outcomes and eliminate or mitigate negative outcomes for boys and men of color in the state. This bill would establish the Boys and Men of Color Task Force Fund, to carry out the bill's requirements in support of the task force, upon appropriation by the Legislature. The bill would authorize the task force to accept federal funds, gifts, donations, grants, or bequests for all or any of its purposes.", "scraped_subjects": ["Interagency Task Force on the Status of Boys and Men of Color."], "bill_id": "AB 80"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00015251"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [{"type": "committee", "name": "Standing Committee on Rules", "id": "CAC000778"}], "actor": "upper", "action": "Introduced.

The state board's duties include, but are not limited to, conducting research, studies, and demonstration programs relating to the provision of a dependable, safe supply of drinking water, enforcing the federal Safe Drinking Water Act (federal act) , and adopting and enforcing regulations. Existing law requires the state board to appoint a deputy director to oversee the issuance and enforcement of public water system permits and delegates ceratin authorities of the state board to the deputy director.\n\nThis bill would authorize the state board to adopt, as emergency regulations, any regulation necessary to ensure consistency with the requirements for state primacy enforcement responsibility under the federal act. The bill would require that these emergency regulations not be subject to review by the Office of Administrative Law and remain in effect until revised by the state board.\n\nThe state act prohibits the state board from issuing a permit to a public water system or amending a valid existing permit to allow the use of point-of-use treatment unless the state board determines that there is no community opposition to the installation of the treatment device. The act also limits the issuance of this permit to no more than 3 years or until funding for centralized treatment is available, whichever occurs first.\n\nThis bill would also prohibit the use of point-of-entry treatment absent that state board determination, and would delete the limits on the duration of these permits. Additionally, the bill would authorize the state board to adopt regulations, similar to those previously authorized for adoption by the State Department of Public Health, governing the use of point-of-entry and point-of-use treatment by a public water system with less than 200 service connections in lieu of centralized treatment where it can be demonstrated that centralized treatment is not immediately economically feasible.\n\nThe state act authorizes the deputy director to issue an order directing certain actions whenever the deputy director determines that a person has violated or is violating the act, or any permit, regulation, or standard issued or adopted pursuant to the act. The act authorizes an aggrieved party 30 days after service of a copy of the order or decision to file with the superior court a petition for a writ of mandate for review of the order or decision.\n\nThe bill would authorize, as an alternative to filing with the superior court a petition for a writ of mandate and within 30 days of issuance of an order or decision issued by the deputy director, an aggrieved person to petition the state board for reconsideration and would authorize the state board to refuse to reconsider the order or decision, to deny the petition, or to set aside or modify the order or decision, as specified.\n\nThe state act authorizes the state board to take certain actions relating to the inspection of public water systems, including inspecting and copying any records, reports, test results, or other information required to carry out the provisions of the act. Existing law makes it a crime for any person to knowingly commit certain acts, including making a false statement or representation in any application, record, report, or other document submitted, maintained, or used for the purposes of compliance with the act or withholding information requested by the state board regarding imminent and substantial danger to the public health or safety, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the owner of a public water system to provide to the state board reports, test results, and other information required to carry out the act within 5 business days of a request from a duly authorized representative of the state board. To the extent that a person knowingly makes a false statement or representation on the information requested by the duly authorized representative, this bill would expand the scope of a crime and thereby impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would declare the intent of the Legislature that the state act be construed to ensure consistency with the requirements for states to obtain and maintain primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems under the federal act.\n\n(2) Existing law generally grants various powers to cities, counties, and certain special districts, including the power to issue bonds and incur indebtedness for certain purposes and subject to certain restrictions. Existing law authorizes counties, cities, and special districts that provide or intend to provide water treatment facilities or services, subject to applicable constitutional restrictions, to borrow money and incur indebtedness for purposes of the State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund.\n\nExisting law, the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund Law of 1997, continuously appropriates state and federal funds in the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund to the State Water Resources Control Board for grants or revolving fund loans for the design and construction of projects for public water systems that will enable those systems to meet safe drinking water standards. The revolving fund law defines \"public agency,\" for purposes of the act, to mean a city, county, city and county, joint powers authority, or other political subdivision of the state, that owns or operates a public water system.\n\nThis bill would expand the definition of \"public agency\" to include a municipality, as defined in the federal act. The bill would extend the authorization to borrow money and incur indebtedness to cities, counties, and special districts for purposes of the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.\n\nThe revolving fund law requires the state board to annually establish the interest rate for repayable financing made pursuant to these provisions, as specified. The revolving fund law authorizes the State Water Resources Control Board to undertake certain actions to implement the revolving fund law, including engaging in the transfer of capitalization grant funds, as specified. Existing law prohibits more than 4% of the capitalization grant from being used by the state board for administering the revolving fund law and authorizes the state board to establish a reasonable schedule for administrative fees to be paid by the grant applicant to reimburse the state for the costs of the administration of these provisions.\n\nThe bill would delete the requirement that the state board establish the interest rate annually and would instead authorize the state board to adjust the interest rate periodically. The bill would delete the prohibition against using more than 4% of the capitalization grant for administrating the Safe Drinking Water Revolving Fund Law and would delete the authorization permitting the state board to establish a reasonable schedule for administrative fees. The bill would instead create the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund Administrative Fund and would require moneys transferred to pay for the costs incurred by the state board for administering the act, moneys collected for financial assistance services, and interest earned upon these moneys to be deposited into the fund. The bill would authorize, where financial assistance is made and is to be repaid to the state board, the state board to assess an annual charge for financial assistance services, not to exceed 1% of the financial assistance balance. The bill would make moneys in the administration fund available to the state board, upon appropriation by the Legislation, for payment of reasonable costs of administering the fund. The bill would require the state board to set the total amount of revenue that is collected each year though the annual charge for financial assistance services at an amount that is equal as practicable to the appropriation amount set forth in the annual Budget Act. The bill would require, at least once each fiscal year, the state board to adjust the financial assistance service charge to conform with the annual Budget Act.\n\n(3) Existing law generally prohibits the state, or a county, city, district, or other political subdivision, or any public officer or body acting in its official capacity on behalf of any of those entities, from being required to pay any fee for the performance of an official service. Existing law exempts from this provision any fee or charge for official services required pursuant to specified provisions of law relating to water use or water quality, including the fees charged to public water systems under the California Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\nThis bill would specifically exempt other provisions relating to water use and water quality, including the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund Law of 1997 and provisions relating to cross-connections of water users, water treatment devices, and operator certification of water treatment plants and water distribution systems.\n\n(4) Existing law, the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, requires all groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins by the Department of Water Resources that are designated as basins subject to critical conditions of overdraft to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2020, and requires all other groundwater basins designated as high- or medium-priority basins to be managed under a groundwater sustainability plan or coordinated groundwater sustainability plans by January 31, 2022, except as specified. The act authorizes the state board to designate a basin as a probationary basin if the state board makes a certain determination and to develop an interim plan for the probationary basin. The act requires a local agency or groundwater sustainability agency to have 90 or 180 days, as prescribed, to remedy the deficiency if the state board designates the basin as a probationary basin.\n\nThis bill would provide a local agency or groundwater sustainability agency 90 or 180 days, as prescribed, to remedy certain deficiencies that caused the state board to designate the basin as a probationary basin. This bill would authorize the state board to develop an interim plan for certain probationary basins one year after the designation of the basin as a probationary basin.\n\n(5) Existing law, the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, establishes the State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund program pursuant to which state and federal funds are continuously appropriated from the State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund to the state board for permissible purposes authorized by the federal Clean Water Act or a federal capitalization grant deposited into the fund, including loans and other financial assistance for the construction of publicly owned treatment works by a municipality, the implementation of a management program, the development and implementation of a conservation and management plan, and other related purposes in accordance with the federal Clean Water Act and the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act.\n\nThis bill would instead require that moneys in the fund be used only for purposes allowed by the federal Clean Water Act or a federal grant, and would delete the specifications of the types of projects and programs eligible for this financial assistance. By allowing moneys in the fund to be used for purposes allowed by a federal grant, thereby expanding the purposes for which moneys in a continuously appropriated revolving fund may be expended, this bill would make an appropriation.\n\nExisting law requires the loans to meet certain criteria, including full amortization not later than 20 years after project completion, unless otherwise authorized by a federal capitalization grant deposited into the fund. Existing law also authorizes loan forgiveness to the extent it is authorized by a federal capitalization grant deposited into the fund.\n\nThe bill would extend the loan amortization requirement to not later than 30 years after project completion unless otherwise authorized by a federal grant deposited in the fund and would authorize loan forgiveness to the extent it is authorized by a federal grant deposited into the fund without regard to whether it is a capitalization grant.\n\nExisting law also authorizes moneys in the fund to be used for payment of the reasonable cost of administering the fund and conducting certain activities relating to the federal Clean Water Act. Existing law prohibits those costs from exceeding 4% of all federal contributions into the fund except, if permitted by federal and state law, interest payments into the fund and other moneys into the fund are authorized to be used to defray additional administrative and activity costs.\n\nThe bill would instead prohibit the costs used for administering the fund and conducting the federal Clean Water Act activities from exceeding 4% of all federal contributions in the fund, $400,000 per year, or 15 of 1% per year of the current valuation of the fund, whichever is greater, plus the amount of fees collected by the state for these purposes, regardless of source.\n\n(6) This bill would make various nonsubstantive changes, including repealing obsolete provisions and updating cross-references.\n\n(7) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

This bill would authorize a certified nurse-midwife to provide peripartum care in an out-of-hospital setting to low-risk women with uncomplicated singleton-term pregnancies who are expected to have uncomplicated birth.\n\n(3) The act authorizes a certified nurse-midwife to furnish and order drugs or devices incidentally to the provision of family planning services, routine health care or perinatal care, and care rendered consistently with the certified nurse-midwife's educational preparation in specified facilities and clinics, and only in accordance with standardized procedures and protocols, as specified.\n\nThis bill would delete the requirement that drugs or devices are furnished or ordered in accordance with standardized procedures and protocols.

The commission has not been funded in recent fiscal years.\n\nThis bill would delete the expression of legislative intent relating to the establishment of nonresident student tuition policies at the University of California and the California State University that are consistent with resident student fee policies. The bill would instead require that nonresident student tuition be determined by each of these segments through the adoption of a methodology that annually establishes the nonresident student tuition at each campus of the segment.\n\nThe bill would require that under no circumstances shall the level of nonresident tuition plus required student fees charged by a campus fall below the total nonresident charges imposed by each of their comparison institutions, as identified by the California Postsecondary Education Commission or a successor agency. The bill would also require that an unspecified percentage of the revenues generated from nonresident enrollment be directed to financial aid programs for resident students.\n\nThe bill would prohibit the number of nonresident students enrolled at any campus of the University of California from exceeding 10% of total student enrollment. The bill would further prohibit any campus of the University of California at which nonresident enrollment exceeds 10% of total student enrollment as of the operative date of the bill from increasing the enrollment of nonresident students from the amount of those students enrolled at that campus on that date. The bill would require the University of California to annually publish a report including specified data about the revenues generated by nonresident student enrollment, and to provide for equitable distribution of those revenues among the campuses.\n\nThe bill would declare that, notwithstanding the existing provision that would make this bill applicable to the University of California only upon the action of the regents, a campus of the University of California would not be deemed to be authorized by the State of California for purposes of its students receiving federal financial aid unless the campus is in compliance with this bill.", "chamber": "lower", "bill_id": "AB 1370"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00016958"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [], "actor": "lower", "action": "Introduced.

Existing law allows the public financing authority to submit a proposition to establish or change the appropriations limit of an enhanced infrastructure financing district to the qualified electors of a proposed or established district, which is effective if approved by the qualified electors.\n\nExisting law also authorizes an enhanced infrastructure financing district to fund infrastructure projects through tax increment financing, pursuant to the infrastructure financing plan and the agreement of affected taxing entities, as defined.\n\nThis bill would repeal those provisions allowing the public financing authority to submit a proposition to establish or change the appropriations limit of the district, and instead provide that the allocation and payment to an enhanced infrastructure district of tax increment for the purpose of paying specified amounts incurred by the district is not the receipt by a district of proceeds of taxes levied by or on behalf of the district within the meaning or for the purposes of Article XIII B, and is not the receipt of proceeds of taxes by, or an appropriation subject to limitation of, any other public body within the meaning or for purposes of Article XIII B.", "chamber": "lower", "bill_id": "AB 313"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00015350"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [], "actor": "lower", "action": "Read first time.

The Department of Justice has related investigatory and enforcement duties under the act. Any violation of these provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor, as specified.\n\nThis bill, which would be known as the Internet Poker Consumer Protection Act of 2015, would establish a framework to authorize intrastate Internet poker, as specified. The bill would authorize eligible entities to apply to the commission for a 10-year nontransferable license to operate an intrastate Internet poker Web site offering the play of authorized Internet poker games to registered players within California, as specified. The bill would require that the license be automatically renewed every 10 years upon application, as specified. The bill would prohibit the offer or play of any gambling game provided over the Internet that is not an authorized Internet poker game permitted by the state pursuant to this bill. The bill would provide that it is unlawful for a person to aggregate computers or any other device with Internet access capabilities in a place of public accommodation within the state, including a public or private club or other association, in a public or private setting, that can accommodate multiple players to simultaneously play authorized games on the Internet, or to promote, facilitate, or market that activity. The bill would provide that any violation of the Internet Poker Consumer Protection Act of 2015 is punishable as a misdemeanor. By creating new crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would require the commission, and any other state agency with a duty pursuant to these provisions, to adopt regulations within 180 days after the operative date of this bill, in consultation with the department and federally recognized California Indian tribes, to implement these provisions, and to facilitate the operation of authorized poker Web sites and expedite the state's receipt of revenues. The bill would require an eligible entity, as defined, to pay an application processing fee sufficient to cover all reasonable costs associated with the issuance of the license, for deposit into the Internet Poker Fund, as created by the bill, to be continuously appropriated to the department and the commission in the amounts necessary to perform their duties pursuant to this bill. An operator license applicant that is a federally recognized Indian tribe also would be required to submit a limited waiver of its sovereign immunity. The bill would require a service provider to apply to the commission for a service provider license before providing goods or services to a licensed operator in connection with the operation of an authorized poker Web site and pay an application processing fee sufficient to cover the reasonable costs associated with the issuance of the license. The bill would require the department to review the suitability of a service provider applicant and would require the department, prior to issuing a service provider license, to issue a finding of suitability and conduct a full investigation of the service provider license applicant. The bill would require a marketing affiliate to apply to the commission for a marketing affiliate license or registration before providing marketing services to a licensed operator in connection with the operation of an authorized poker Web site and pay an application processing fee sufficient to cover the reasonable costs associated with the issuance of the license. Except as provided, the bill would require the department to review the suitability of a marketing affiliate license or registration applicant and would require the department, prior to issuing a license or registration, to issue a finding of suitability and conduct a full investigation of the marketing affiliate license or registration applicant.\n\nThe bill would require employees of a licensed operator, a licensed service provider, or a licensed or registered marketing affiliate to obtain employee work permits, and owners, officers, and directors of a licensed operator to be subject to a suitability review and obtain employee work permits, and would authorize the commission to refuse to issue a license to, or suspend or revoke a license of, a licensed operator that fails to comply with these requirements. The bill would establish a tribal gaming regulatory authority process for the purpose of processing employee work permits, and authorize a tribe that is a licensed operator to elect to participate in the tribal gaming regulatory authority process.\n\nThis bill would authorize the commission to revoke or suspend any license or work permit upon reaching a finding that the licensee or employee is in violation of the provisions described above, or any regulation adopted pursuant to these provisions. However, the bill would prohibit a tribal licensee from having its license suspended or revoked, or being fined or otherwise penalized for complying with any applicable federal law or regulation when operating an authorized poker Web site on Indian lands. The bill would specify that to the extent that any state requirement is more strict than any applicable federal law requirement, the tribal licensee is required to comply with the state requirement.\n\nThis bill would require a registered player account to be established in person, and would also require that specified deposits into and withdrawals out of those accounts be made in person. In order to satisfy those in-person requirements, the bill would authorize a licensed operator to enter into an agreement for the operation of one or more satellite service centers, which would be authorized to act on behalf of, or in coordination with, the licensed operator in carrying out those in-person requirements. The bill would require a licensed operator to ensure, among other things, that the satellite service center is financially, logistically, and technologically capable of performing specified duties in accordance with the bill's provisions. The bill would provide that both the satellite service center and the licensed operator may be held liable for any violation of the bill's provisions arising out of an agreement between the satellite service center and the licensed operator to provide specified in-person services. The bill would also authorize the commission to promulgate regulations regarding satellite service centers for the protection of licensed operators, registered players, and intrastate Internet poker, or that otherwise serve the purposes of the bill.\n\nThis bill would require the payment of an annual regulatory fee, for deposit into the Internet Poker Fund, to be continuously appropriated for the actual costs of license oversight, consumer protection, state regulation, and other purposes related to this bill. The bill would require each licensee to pay a one-time license deposit into the General Fund in the amount of $5,000,000. The license deposit would be credited against quarterly fees equivalent to 5% of the licensee's gross gaming revenue proceeds, as specified. The bill would require an applicant for an operator license to provide documentation establishing that the applicant is qualified to pay the one-time license deposit through its own net position or through credit directly to the applicant, as specified.\n\nThis bill would establish the Unlawful Gambling Enforcement Fund within the General Fund for purposes of ensuring adequate resources for law enforcement charged with enforcing the prohibitions and protections of the provisions described above. The bill would authorize the Attorney General, and other public prosecutors, as specified, to bring a civil action to recover a civil penalty in an unspecified amount against a person who engages in those prohibited activities described above, or other specified unlawful gambling activities. The bill would provide for an unspecified percentage of revenues from civil penalties collected to be deposited into the fund and used for law enforcement activities pursuant to these provisions, upon appropriation by the Legislature.\n\nThis bill would require the commission, in consultation with the department, the Treasurer, and the Franchise Tax Board, to issue a report to the Legislature describing the state's efforts to meet the policy goals articulated in this bill within one year of the operative date of this bill and, annually, thereafter. The bill would also require the Bureau of State Audits, at least 4 years after the issue date of any license by the state, but no later than 5 years after that date, to issue a report to the Legislature detailing the implementation of this bill, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the state to affirmatively elect to be subject to a federal Internet gambling law, and would prohibit the state from participating in any Internet gambling agreement between states or foreign jurisdictions without an affirmative legislative act. The bill would provide that if the state elects to be subject to a federal Internet gambling law or to participate in an Internet gambling agreement between states or foreign jurisdictions, an operator licensee shall not be required to pay the one-time license fee or the quarterly fees described above and would require the state to refund within 30 days all unused license fees paid to the state, as specified. The bill would authorize a licensee to enforce this provision in the superior court.\n\nThe bill would provide that specified provisions are not severable.\n\n(2) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\n(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\n(4) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.", "chamber": "lower", "bill_id": "AB 9"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00014744"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [{"type": "committee", "name": "Standing Committee on Rules", "id": "CAC000778"}], "actor": "upper", "action": "Introduced.
