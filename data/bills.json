Among other things, the act requires the California State University and each community college district, and requests the University of California, with respect to each campus in their respective jurisdictions that administers a priority enrollment system, to grant priority in that system for registration for enrollment to foster youth, as defined, or former foster youth, until the repeal of this provision on January 1, 2017.\n\nThis bill would enact the Success for Homeless Youth in Higher Education Act.

To the extent that this provision would impose new duties on community college districts, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.\n\n(2) Existing provisions of the Donahoe Higher Education Act set forth various duties and responsibilities for state entities, such as the California State University, the California Community Colleges, the University of California, and the Treasurer, with respect to federal assistance to higher education. Existing provisions of the Ortiz-Pacheco-Poochigian-Vasconcellos Cal Grant Program set forth the requirements for status as a \"qualifying institution,\" whose students are eligible, if as individuals they meet pertinent program requirements, to receive Cal Grant awards. \n\nThis bill would require qualifying institutions, other than the University of California, which would be requested to do so, to designate a Homeless and Foster Student Liaison within the institution's financial aid office and to inform current and prospective students of the institution about student financial aid and other assistance available to current and former homeless youth and current and former foster youth, as specified. To the extent that this provision would impose new duties on community college districts, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.\n\n(3) Existing law establishes standards relating to the determination of a student's residence for purposes of setting the amount of tuition and fees that are owed by that student. Existing law provides that a student who currently resides in California and is 19 years of age or under at the time of enrollment, and who is currently a dependent or ward of the state through California's child welfare system, or was formerly served by California's child welfare system, as specified, may be entitled to resident classification until he or she has resided in the state the minimum time necessary to become a resident.\n\nThis bill would additionally provide that a student who currently resides in California and is 19 years of age or under at the time of enrollment may be entitled to resident classification until he or she has resided in the state the minimum time necessary to become a resident if he or she has been determined at any time during the 2 years immediately preceding the residency classification determination to be homeless, as defined. To the extent that this provision would impose new duties on community college districts, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.\n\n(4) Existing law establishes the Student Aid Commission and assigns to it numerous duties with respect to student financial aid programs, including the Community College Student Financial Aid Outreach Program and the Student Opportunity and Access Program. Both of these programs include provisions addressing the needs of youth from low-income households, and specifically include low-income youth within the scope of the respective programs.\n\nThis bill would additionally place homeless youth and former homeless youth, as defined, within the scope of these programs.\n\n(5) Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges. Existing law requires the governing board of each community college district to charge an enrollment fee of $46 per unit per semester, but authorizes the waiver of this fee for students meeting specified requirements.\n\nThis bill would add a person who is, at the time of enrollment, a homeless youth or former homeless youth, as defined, to the groups of persons eligible for this fee waiver. To the extent that this provision would impose new duties on community college districts, it would constitute a state-mandated local program.\n\n(6) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.", "scraped_subjects": ["Postsecondary education: Success for Homeless Youth in Higher Education Act."], "bill_id": "AB 801"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00016116"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [], "actor": "lower", "date": "2015-02-26 00:00:00", "+actor_info": {"details": "Assembly (Desk)"}, "action": "Read first time.

Upon approval of a long-range property management plan, the plan governs and supersedes all other provisions relating to the disposition and use of the real property assets of the former redevelopment agency.

The act defines the term \"public insurance adjuster\" to mean a person who, for compensation, acts on behalf of, or aids in any manner, an insured in negotiating for or effecting the settlement of a claim or claims for loss or damage under any policy of insurance covering real or personal property or any person who advertises, solicits business, or holds himself or herself out to the public as an adjuster of those claims and any person who, for compensation, investigates, settles, adjusts, advises, or assists an insured with reference to claims for those losses on behalf of any public insurance adjuster. Any person who knowingly falsifies the fingerprints or photographs submitted as part of the application process is guilty of a felony, and any person who violates any other provision governing public insurance adjusters is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $500 or by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year, or by both that fine and imprisonment.\n\nThis bill would revise and recast the above provisions by, among other things, redefining a \"public insurance adjuster\" to include any person who, for compensation or any other thing of value on behalf of an insured, acts or aids, solely in relation to first party claims arising under insurance contracts that insure the real or personal property of the insured, on behalf of an insured in negotiating for, or effecting the settlement of, a claim for loss or damage coverage by an insurance contract, or advertises for employment as a public adjuster of insurance claims or solicits business or represents himself or herself to the public as a public adjuster of first party insurance claims for losses or damages arising out of policies of insurance that insure real or personal property. The bill would expand the categories of persons exempt from the act to include, among others, a person who negotiates or settles claims arising under a life or health insurance policy or an annuity contract and a person who settles subrogation claims between insurers. The bill would place additional eligibility requirements on applicants for a nonresident license. The bill would also repeal the provisions relating to an interim license, and would instead create an apprentice public insurance adjuster license to facilitate the training necessary to ensure reasonable competency in the responsibilities and duties of a public insurance adjuster, and would set forth the various terms and conditions of the license.

Existing law requires the governing board of each school district to establish standards of expected pupil achievement at each grade level in each area of study and to evaluate and assess certificated employee performance on a continuing basis as it reasonably relates to the progress of pupils toward the established standards and, if applicable, the state adopted academic content standards as measured by state adopted criterion referenced assessments, the instructional techniques and strategies used by the employee, the employee's adherence to curricular objectives, and the establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment, within the scope of the employee's responsibilities.\n\nThis bill would provide that the provisions described above would become inoperative on July 1, 2016. The bill would state findings and declarations of the Legislature regarding the nature of effective teachers and of the teaching profession. Commencing on July 1, 2016, the bill would require the governing board of each school district to adopt and implement a locally negotiated best practices teacher evaluation system, described as one in which each teacher is evaluated on a continuing basis on the degree to which he or she accomplishes specific objectives and multiple observations of instructional and other professional practices that are conducted by trained evaluators. The bill would authorize the state board, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Instruction and appropriate education stakeholder groups, to adopt nonregulatory guidance to support the implementation of a best practices teacher evaluation system by school districts, as specified. The bill would also require the governing board of each school district to establish and define job responsibilities for certificated, noninstructional employees whose responsibilities cannot be evaluated appropriately under the best practices teacher evaluation system and to evaluate and assess their performance in relation to the fulfillment of those responsibilities. The bill would, on or before May 1, 2016, require the governing board of each school district, at a regularly scheduled public hearing, to seek comment on the development and implementation of the best practices teacher evaluation system, and, on or before May 1 of each year prior to local negotiations required by law, to seek comment on the best practices teacher evaluation system. The bill also would require the governing board of each school district to disclose the provisions of the best practices teacher evaluation system at a regularly scheduled public hearing. The bill would provide that these provisions do not apply to certificated personnel who are employed on an hourly basis in adult education classes. The bill would also provide that the provisions of the best practices teacher evaluation system do not supersede or invalidate a teacher evaluation system that is locally negotiated and that is in effect at the time the best practices teacher evaluation system becomes operative. By imposing additional duties on school districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would appropriate, for the 2016\u00e2\u20ac\u201c17 fiscal year, an unspecified amount of money from the General Fund to the State Department of Education for allocation to school districts for the purpose of implementing the best practices teachers evaluation system, as specified, thereby making an appropriation.\n\n(2) Existing law requires that an evaluation and assessment of the performance of a certificated employee be made on a continuing basis, as provided, including at least every 5 years for personnel with permanent status who have been employed at least 10 years with the school district, are highly qualified, as specified, and whose previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards, if the evaluator and certificated employee being evaluated agree.\n\nThis bill, commencing July 1, 2016, would require the evaluation and assessment of the above personnel at least every 3 years, except as locally negotiated and provided in the best practices teacher evaluation system. By requiring additional duties on school districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(3) This bill would update cross-references and would make other nonsubstantive changes.\n\n(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.\n\n(5) Funds appropriated by this bill would be applied toward the minimum funding requirements for school districts and community college districts imposed by Section 8 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.", "scraped_subjects": ["Teachers: best practices teacher evaluation system."], "bill_id": "SB 499"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00016466"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [{"type": "committee", "name": "Standing Committee on Rules", "id": "CAC000778"}], "actor": "upper", "action": "Introduced.

Under the department's program, existing law requires FQHCs and RHCs subcontracting with specified managed care plans to seek supplemental reimbursement from the department through a per visit fee-for-service billing system.

In counties in which these assisted outpatient treatment services are available, a court may order a person to receive assisted outpatient treatment for an initial treatment period not to exceed 6 months pursuant to an order if requisite criteria are met. Under that law, participating counties are required to provide prescribed assisted outpatient services, including a service planning and delivery process, that are client-directed and employ psychosocial rehabilitation and recovery principles. Existing law authorizes participating counties to pay for the services provided from moneys distributed to the counties from various continuously appropriated funds, including the Local Revenue Fund and the Mental Health Services Fund when included in a county plan, as specified.\n\nThis bill would delete the provisions that authorize a county to participate in the program, and instead require each county with available funding to implement the provisions of Laura's Law. The bill would delete the January 1, 2017, repeal date of those provisions, thereby extending the program indefinitely. By imposing additional duties upon the counties to implement these provisions, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would also authorize the court to order a person to obtain assisted outpatient treatment for an initial period not to exceed 12 months if requisite criteria are met.\n\nExisting law, the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, authorizes the involuntary detention for a period of 72 hours for evaluation of persons who are dangerous to self or others, or gravely disabled, as defined. Existing law provides that if a person is detained for 72 hours or is under court order for evaluation and has received an evaluation, he or she may be certified for not more than 14 days of intensive treatment related to the mental disorder or impairment by chronic alcoholism if certain conditions are met, as specified. Under existing law, a person may be certified for intensive treatment for an additional period of time if he or she remains gravely disabled or unwilling or unable to accept voluntary treatment or if he or she is suicidal, as specified, or may be confined for postcertification treatment for up to 180 days if he or she has, among other things, attempted or inflicted physical harm upon another person, as specified.\n\nThis bill would, upon the release of a person from intensive treatment or postcertification treatment described above, authorize the professional staff of the agency or facility that provided the treatment to evaluate whether the person meets the criteria for assisted outpatient treatment. The bill would authorize the professional staff to request the county mental health director to file a petition in the superior court for assisted outpatient treatment if that person meets that criteria.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

Under existing law, the patient or client, or parent or guardian of the patient or client, has the right to examine shared immunization-related information and to correct errors in it.\n\nUnder existing law, unless the patient or client or patient's or client's parent or guardian, refuses the recordsharing of information, health care providers and other agencies, including, but not limited to, schools, child care facilities, service providers for the California Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) , health care plans, foster care agencies, and county welfare departments, may disclose, to local health departments operating countywide or regional immunization information and reminder systems and the department, specified information, including, but not limited to, the name, date of birth, gender, and birthplace of a patient or client.\n\nThis bill would include the patient's or client's height, weight, and body mass index, and other patient or client information of public health importance as determined by the department, in consultation with the California Conference of Local Health Officers, in the list of information that may be shared.

Existing law enacted by the Legislature requires the establishment of a program for the issuance of identification cards to qualified patients so that they may lawfully use marijuana for medical purposes, and requires the establishment of guidelines for the lawful cultivation of marijuana grown for medical use. Existing law provides for the licensure of various professions by the Department of Consumer Affairs. Existing law, the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, provides for the regulation of food, drugs, devices, and cosmetics, as specified. A violation of that law is a crime.\n\nThis bill would establish within the Department of Consumer Affairs a Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation, under the supervision and control of the Chief of the Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation, and would require the bureau to license and regulate dispensing facilities, cultivation sites, transporters, and manufacturers of medical marijuana and medical marijuana products, subject to local ordinances. The bill would require a background check of applicants for licensure, as defined, to be administered by the Department of Justice, and submission of a statement signed by an applicant, under penalty of perjury, that the information on his or her application is true, thereby creating a crime and imposing a state-mandated local program. Violation of the provisions related to applying for a conditional license would be punishable by a civil fine of up to $35,000 for each individual violation, or as otherwise specified.\n\nThe bill would make conditional licenses subject to the restrictions of the local jurisdiction in which the facility operates or proposes to operate. The bill would set forth provisions related to the transportation, testing, and distribution of medical marijuana. The bill would prohibit the distribution of any form of advertising for physician recommendations for medical marijuana, unless the advertisement bears a specified notice and requires that the advertisement meet specified requirements and not be fraudulent, deceitful, or misleading. \n\nThe bill would establish a system, including apprenticeship and certification, for cannabis employees. The bill would require the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement to maintain and enforce minimum standards of competency and training and to certify cannabis employees. The bill would require the division to establish a cannabis curriculum certification committee to establish educational curriculum standards and to oversee educational providers of cannabis curriculum. The bill would require the Division of Occupational Health and Safety to develop industry-specific regulations for facilities issued a conditional license and would specify that those regulations govern agreements between a facility issued a conditional license and labor.\n\nThe bill would establish the Medical Marijuana Regulation Fund and would require the deposit of specified fees collected pursuant to this act into the fund. The bill would continuously appropriate moneys from the fund to the bureau for the purposes of administering this act, thereby making an appropriation. The bill would also establish the Special Account for Environmental Enforcement within the Medical Marijuana Fund. This account would contain money from fees assessed against licensed cultivation facilities and would be continuously appropriated for the enforcement of environmental regulations relating to licensed cultivation sites. The bill would require the deposit of penalty moneys collected pursuant to this bill into the General Fund.\n\nThe bill would provide that it shall not supersede provisions of Measure D, as approved by the voters of the City of Los Angeles, as specified.\n\nThe bill would authorize a city, county, or city and county to administer and enforce these provisions. The bill would require the bureau to establish quality assurance protocols by July 1, 2017, to ensure uniform testing standards of medical marijuana, and would require licensees to comply with these provisions. The bill would further set forth provisions regulating edible medical marijuana products, as specified. By adding these provisions to the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law, a violation of which is a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(2) Existing law establishes the Division of Apprenticeship Standards, which audits and regulates apprenticeship programs for various trades, including electricians. \n\nThis bill would require the division to investigate, approve, or reject applications for apprenticeship employees of a licensed cultivation site or a licensed dispensing facility, as defined.\n\n(3) Existing law, the Medical Practice Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of physicians and surgeons by the Medical Board of California. Existing law requires the board to prioritize investigations and prosecutions of physicians and surgeons representing the greatest threat of harm, as specified. Existing law identifies the cases that are to be given priority, which include cases of repeated acts of excessively prescribing, furnishing, or administering controlled substances without a good faith prior examination of the patient. Existing law provides that a violation of the Medical Practice Act is a crime.\n\nThis bill would require the board to consult with the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research on developing and adopting medical guidelines for the appropriate administration and use of marijuana.\n\nThe bill would also make it a misdemeanor for a physician and surgeon who recommends marijuana to a patient for a medical purpose to accept, solicit, or offer any remuneration from or to a licensed dispensing facility in which the physician and surgeon or his or her immediate family has a financial interest. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe bill would provide that specified acts of recommending marijuana for medical purposes without a good faith examination are among the types of cases that should be given priority for investigation and prosecution by the board, as described above. The bill would further prohibit a physician and surgeon from recommending medical marijuana to a patient unless that person is the patient's attending physician, as defined. Because a violation of that provision would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(4) Existing law authorizes the legislative body of a city or county to impose various taxes, including a transactions and use tax at a rate of 0.25%, or a multiple thereof, if approved by the required vote of the legislative body and the required vote of qualified voters, and limits the combined rate of transactions and use taxes within a city or county to 2%.\n\nThis bill would authorize the board of supervisors of a county to impose a tax on the privilege of cultivating, dispensing, producing, processing, preparing, storing, providing, donating, selling, or distributing marijuana or products containing marijuana. The bill would authorize the tax to be imposed for either general or specific governmental purposes. The bill would require a tax imposed pursuant to this authority to be subject to any applicable voter approval requirement.\n\n(5) Existing law exempts qualified patients, persons with valid identification cards, and the designated primary caregivers of qualified patients and persons with identification cards from certain crimes, including possession of concentrated cannabis and marijuana, cultivation of marijuana, and possession of marijuana for sale.\n\nThis bill would also exempt from those crimes an employee, officer, or board member of a licensed cultivation site or a licensed dispensing facility, except as specified.\n\n(6) Existing law regulates the labor practices of agricultural employers.\n\nThis bill would include licensed cultivation sites and licensed dispensing facilities in the definition of agricultural employer.\n\n(7) This bill would provide that its provisions are severable.\n\n(8) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\n(9) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.", "scraped_subjects": ["Medical marijuana."], "bill_id": "AB 266"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00015595"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [], "actor": "lower", "action": "Read first time.

The bill would authorize the state board, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Instruction and appropriate education stakeholder groups, to adopt nonregulatory guidance to support the implementation of a best practices teacher evaluation system by school districts, as specified. The bill would, on or before May 1, 2016, require the governing board of each school district, at a regularly scheduled public hearing, to seek comment on the development and implementation of the best practices teacher evaluation system, and, on or before May 1 of each year prior to local negotiations required by law, to seek comment on the best practices teacher evaluation system. The bill also would require the governing board of each school district to disclose the provisions of the best practices teacher evaluation system at a regularly scheduled public hearing. The bill would also require the governing board of each school district to establish and define job responsibilities for certificated, noninstructional employees and evaluate and assess their performance in relation to those responsibilities. The bill would provide that these provisions do not apply to certificated personnel who are employed on an hourly basis in adult education classes. The bill would also provide that the provisions of the best practices teacher evaluation system do not supersede or invalidate a teacher evaluation system that is locally negotiated and that is in effect at the time the best practices teacher evaluation system becomes operative.\n\n(3) Existing law requires that an evaluation and assessment of the performance of a certificated employee be made on a continuing basis, as provided, including at least every 5 years for personnel with permanent status who have been employed at least 10 years with the school district, are highly qualified, as specified, and whose previous evaluation rated the employee as meeting or exceeding standards, if the evaluator and certificated employee being evaluated agree.\n\nThis bill, commencing July 1, 2018, would require the evaluation and assessment of the above personnel at least every 3 years, except as locally negotiated and provided in the best practices teacher evaluation system.\n\n(4) Under the California Constitution, whenever the Legislature or a state agency mandates a new program or higher level of service on any local government, including a school district and a community college district, the state is required to provide a subvention of funds to reimburse the local government, with specified exceptions. Existing law requires certain funds appropriated in the annual Budget Act for reimbursement of the cost of a new program or increased level of service of an existing program mandated by statute or executive order to be available as a block grant to school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to support specified state-mandated local programs and permits those entities to elect to receive that block grant funding in lieu of claiming mandated costs pursuant to the state claims process.\n\nThis bill would, as of July 1, 2018, add the best practices teacher evaluation system to the state-mandated local programs supported by the block grant funding.\n\n(5) This bill would update cross-references and would make other nonsubstantive changes.\n\n(6) By requiring school districts to perform additional duties, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.", "scraped_subjects": ["Teachers: best practices teacher evaluation system."], "bill_id": "AB 575"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00015843"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [], "actor": "lower", "action": "Read first time.

A willful or knowing violation of this requirement is punishable by a fine and imprisonment.\n\nThis bill would also require a licensee to report the filing of an criminal complaint charging a felony against the licensee to the Bureau of Real Estate. Because the bill would change the definition of a crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe bill would also make other nonsubstantive changes.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.", "chamber": "lower", "bill_id": "AB 685"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00016009"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [], "actor": "lower", "action": "Read first time.

The disclosure is required to be provided prior to, or concurrent with, the application and prior to each renewal to which the policy provision applies.\n\nThis bill would require the disclosure to be on the first page of a policy and in a specified font size.\n\n(2) Existing law requires certain insurance disclosures in various circumstances, including, but not limited to, when a life or disability insurance policy or certificate of coverage is first issued or delivered to a new insured or policyholder, when an employer obtains coverage from a multiple employer welfare arrangement, and when a claim is up for settlement.\n\nThis bill would require those disclosures to also include the Department of Insurance's Internet Web site.\n\n(3) Existing law defines the term \"Adjusted RBC Report\" as a Risk-Based Capital (RBC) report that has been adjusted by the Insurance Commissioner in accordance with specified provisions governing the determination of a property and casualty insurer's RBC. Existing law requires the filing of an RBC report by a life or health insurer if the insurer has a Total Adjusted Capital that is greater than or equal to its Company Action Level RBC but the Total Adjusted Capital is less than the product of its Authorized Control Level RBC and 2.5.\n\nThis bill would require the RBC report if the Total Adjusted Capital is less than the product of its Authorized Control Level RBC and 3.0.\n\n(4) Existing law provides requirements for various written insurance-related documents, including, among other things, the requirement on a licensee to include certain information on a business card, the requirement on all individual life insurance policies and individual annuity contracts to be in certain font, and an outline of coverage for long-term care insurance policies.\n\nThis bill would modify the requirements with respect to those written documents, as specified.\n\n(5) Existing law requires an applicant or licensee to update his or her application if background information that was provided in the application for a license changes.\n\nThis bill would expand the definition of a license to include, among others, title insurance.\n\n(6) This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to correct obsolete cross-references and would delete obsolete provisions.\n\n(7) Existing law, governing life and disability insurance, provides, among other things, that the only measure of insurer liability and damage is the sum payable to the insured in the manner and at the times as provided in the policy.

Existing law authorizes counties to participate in the CalFresh Employment and Training Program (CalFresh E&T) , established by federal law, and requires participating counties to screen CalFresh work registrants to determine whether they will participate in, or be deferred from, the CalFresh E&T program.\n\nExisting federal law limits an able-bodied adult without dependents (ABAWD) participant to 3 months of CalFresh benefits in a 3-year period unless that participant has met specified work participation requirements.

Within a specified period of time after filing its original statement and designation and annually thereafter, existing law, the General Corporation Law, requires every foreign corporation, including foreign nonprofit corporations, as specified, to file a statement, known as a Statement of Information, with the Secretary of State containing specified information, including the street address of its principal executive office and its mailing address.\n\nThis bill would authorize the Secretary of State to also obtain address information from the Franchise Tax Board to use in providing notices to a foreign corporation, including these foreign nonprofit corporations. This bill would specifically authorize the Franchise Tax Board to disclose this information.\n\n(2) Existing law authorizes the corporate powers, rights, and privileges of a domestic taxpayer to be suspended, and the exercise of the corporate powers, rights, and privileges of a foreign taxpayer in this state to be forfeited, if certain tax liabilities are not paid or a taxpayer fails to file a tax return. Existing law also authorizes the corporate powers, rights, and privileges of a domestic corporation exempt from income tax to be suspended and the exercise of the corporate powers, rights, and privileges of a foreign corporation in this state exempt from income tax to be forfeited if the organization fails to file the annual information return or a specified statement for organizations not required to file the information return or pay a specified amount due. Existing law requires notice prior to the suspension or forfeiture of a taxpayer's corporate powers, rights, and privileges. Existing law requires the Franchise Tax Board to transmit to the Secretary of State the names of those taxpayers subject to these suspension or forfeiture provisions and thereby makes the suspension or forfeiture effective. Under existing law, the Secretary of State's certificate is prima facie evidence of the suspension or forfeiture.\n\nUnder existing law, a corporation that fails to file a Statement of Information with the Secretary of State within a specified time period and was certified for penalty is subject to suspension rather than penalty. Existing law requires the Secretary of State to provide a notice to the nonprofit corporation informing it that its corporate powers, rights, and privileges will be suspended within a specified time period if the Statement of Information is not filed. If the nonprofit corporation does not file the Statement of Information, existing law requires the Secretary of State to notify the Franchise Tax Board and the nonprofit corporation of the suspension and upon that notification the corporate powers, rights, and privileges of the nonprofit corporation are suspended.\n\nThis bill would make a nonprofit public benefit corporation, a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation, a nonprofit religious corporation, and a foreign nonprofit corporation, subject to administrative dissolution or administrative surrender, as specified, if the nonprofit corporation's corporate powers are, and have been, suspended or forfeited by the Franchise Tax Board for a specified period of time or if the nonprofit corporation has not filed a Statement of Information with the Secretary of State for a specified period of time. Prior to the administrative dissolution or administrative surrender of the nonprofit corporation, the bill would require either the Franchise Tax Board or the Secretary of State to provide notice to the nonprofit corporation of the pending administrative dissolution or administrative surrender. The bill would also require the Secretary of State to provide notice of the pending administrative dissolution or administrative surrender on its Internet Web site, as specified. The bill would authorize a nonprofit corporation to provide the Franchise Tax Board or the Secretary of State with a written objection to the administrative dissolution or administrative surrender. If there is no written objection or the written objection fails, the bill would require the nonprofit corporation to be administratively dissolved or administratively surrendered and would provide that the certificate of the Secretary of State is prima facie evidence of the administrative dissolution or administrative surrender. Upon administrative dissolution or administrative surrender, the bill would abate the nonprofit corporation's liabilities for qualified taxes, interest, and penalties, as provided.\n\n(3) Existing law, the Nonprofit Corporation Law, authorizes a nonprofit public benefit corporation, nonprofit mutual benefit corporation, and nonprofit religious corporation to elect voluntarily to wind up and dissolve by either approval of a majority of all members or approval of the board and approval of the members. Under existing law, the General Corporation Law, when a corporation has not issued shares, a majority of the directors, or, if no directors have been named in the articles or have been elected, the incorporator or a majority of the incorporators, are authorized to sign and verify a specified certificate of dissolution. Existing law requires the certificate to be filed with the Secretary of State and requires the Secretary of State to notify the Franchise Tax Board of the dissolution. Existing law provides that, upon the filing of the certificate, a corporation is dissolved and its powers, rights, and privileges cease.\n\nThis bill would enact provisions similar to those General Corporation Law provisions and make them applicable to nonprofit public benefit corporations, nonprofit mutual benefit corporations, and nonprofit religious corporations. The bill would additionally provide that liability to creditors, if any, is not discharged, the liability of the directors of the dissolved nonprofit corporation is not discharged, and the dissolution of a nonprofit corporation does not diminish or adversely affect the ability of the Attorney General to enforce specified liabilities.\n\n(4) Existing law requires every corporation doing business within the limits of this state and not expressly exempted from taxation to annually pay to the state, for the privilege of exercising its corporate franchises within this state, a tax according to or measured by its net income, as specified. Under existing law, every corporation, except as specified, is subject to the minimum franchise tax until the effective date of dissolution or withdrawal or, if later, the date the corporation ceases to do business within the limits of this state. Upon certification by the Secretary of State that a nonprofit public benefit corporation or a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation has failed to file the required Statement of Information, existing law requires the Franchise Tax Board to assess a specified penalty.\n\nThis bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to abate, upon written request by a qualified nonprofit corporation, as defined, unpaid qualified taxes, interest, and penalties, as defined, for the taxable years in which the nonprofit corporation certifies, under penalty of perjury, that it was not doing business, as defined. The bill would make this abatement conditioned on the dissolution of the qualified corporation within a specified period of time of filing the request for abatement. The bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to prescribe rules and regulations to carry out these abatement provisions and would exempt these rules and regulations from the Administrative Procedure Act.\n\n(5) Existing state constitutional law prohibits the Legislature from making any gift, or authorizing the making of any gift, of any public money or thing of value to any individual, municipal, or other corporation.\n\nThis bill would make certain legislative findings and declarations that abatement of a nonprofit corporation's liabilities for specified taxes, penalties, and interest serves a statewide public purpose, as provided.\n\n(6) By expanding the crime of perjury, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

Existing law requires the board to require school districts and county offices of education that receive funding under the Greene Act of 1998 to establish a restricted account within the school district's or county office of education's general fund and to deposit, in each fiscal year for 20 years, a minimum amount equal to or greater than 3% of the school district's or county office of education's total general fund expenditures, including other financing uses, for that fiscal year into the account for maintenance of school facilities.

Existing law provides that the Commission on Teacher Credentialing shall encourage postsecondary institutions that offer programs of professional preparation to collaborate with school districts, county offices of education, and professional organizations in the design and delivery of local programs to function as part of the California beginning teacher support and assessment program. If local educational agencies and institutions of higher education voluntarily agree to implement the program, existing law requires, in each program of preparation, support, and assessment, the postsecondary institution to make it possible for each candidate to complete all requirements for a valid teaching credential in the equivalent of one year of full-time study.\n\nThis bill would instead require the postsecondary institution to make it possible for each candidate to compete all requirements for a valid teaching credential in the equivalent of 2 years of full-time study.\n\n(5) Existing law requires the State Department of Education, and authorizes the Compton Unified School District, to identify low-performing schools in the school district, as provided, for purposes of providing extended school year instruction.

The bill would also require county child welfare agencies, by July 1, 2016, to develop and implement specific protocols to expeditiously locate any child missing from foster care, as specified. By imposing these requirements on county agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(2) Under existing law, a county social worker develops a case plan that, among other things, identifies the child welfare services that will be provided to a minor or nonminor dependent. Existing law requires the county child welfare agency to give the child a meaningful opportunity to participate in the development of the case plan.\n\nThis bill would require county child welfare agencies to develop case plans for youth 14 years of age or older and nonminor dependents in consultation with the youth, and would authorize the youth to choose up to 2 members of the case planning team, as specified. The bill would require that case plans for these youth include a description of specified rights and entitlements, as well as an acknowledgment signed by the youth that he or she was provided with this information. The bill would also require the case plan for a child or nonminor dependent who is, or who is at risk of becoming, the victim of commercial sexual exploitation, to document the services provided to address that issue. By imposing these case planning requirements on county child welfare agencies, this will would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(3) Existing law requires a caregiver of a dependent child to use a reasonable and prudent parent standard in determining whether to give permission for a child residing in foster care to participate in extracurricular, enrichment, and social activities.\n\nThis bill would require that training for caregivers include knowledge and skills relating to the reasonable and prudent parent standard for participation in age or developmentally appropriate activities. The bill would also require each licensed community care facility that provides care and supervision to children, except licensed foster family homes and certified family homes, to designate at least one onsite staff member to apply the reasonable and prudent parent standard to decisions involving the participation of the child in age or developmentally appropriate activities. To the extent this bill would impose foster parent training requirements on counties, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n (4) Existing law requires a county welfare department, county probation department, or the State Department of Social Services to annually obtain a credit report, as specified, for a child in foster care who is 16 years of age or older.\n\nThis bill would require that these services be provided to a child in foster care who is 14 years of age or older. By increasing the level of service provided by counties, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(5) Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to implement a statewide Child Welfare Services/Case Management System to effectively administer and evaluate the state's child welfare services and foster care programs.\n\nThis bill would require the department to ensure that the Child Welfare Services/Case Management System is capable of collecting specified information relating to the number of foster children who are, or are at risk of becoming, victims of commercial sexual exploitation.\n\n(6) The Child Abuse Neglect and Reporting Act makes certain persons mandated reporters, and requires those persons to report to a police department, sheriff's department, county probation department, or the county welfare department whenever he or she knows or reasonably suspects that a child has been the victim of child abuse or neglect, as specified. Existing law requires the county probation or welfare department to immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, report to the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction over the case, to the agency given the responsibility for investigation of cases of child abuse and neglect, and to the district attorney's office every known or suspected instance of child abuse or neglect.\n\nThis bill would additionally require the county probation or welfare department to report immediately, or in no case later than 24 hours from receipt of the information, any known or suspected instance of child abuse involves an allegation of sexual exploitation, as defined, of a child or youth receiving child welfare services. The bill would also require the county probation or welfare department to make a report to the appropriate law enforcement authority for entry into the National Crime Information Center database of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children within 24 hours of becoming aware that a child or youth who is receiving child welfare services and who is known or suspected to be the victim of sexual exploitation is missing or has been abducted. By increasing the duties of county probation and welfare departments, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\n(7) Existing law establishes the Adoption Assistance Program for the purpose of benefiting children residing in foster homes by providing the stability and security of permanent homes. Existing law requires that any savings realized from the change in federal funding for adoption assistance resulting from the enactment of the federal Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 be spent for the provision of foster care and adoption services.\n\nThis bill would require that at least 30% of that savings be spent on postadoption services, postguardianship services, and services to support and sustain positive permanent outcomes for children who might enter foster care, as specified.\n\n(8) The Kinship Guardianship Assistance Payments for Children (Kin-GAP) Program provides financial assistance to children who are eligible for foster care maintenance payments and are placed in legal guardianship with a relative. Under existing law, termination of the guardianship terminates eligibility for Kin-GAP, unless an alternate kinship guardian or coguardian is appointed, as provided.\n\nThis bill would instead provide that if a successor kinship guardian is appointed, the successor guardian is entitled to receive Kin-GAP on behalf of the child if the reason for the appointment is the death or incapacity of the kinship guardian and the successor guardian is named in the kinship guardianship assistance agreement.\n\n(9) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.", "scraped_subjects": ["Child welfare services."], "bill_id": "SB 794"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00017123"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [], "actor": "lower", "date": "2015-02-27 00:00:00", "+actor_info": {"details": "Assembly (Desk)"}, "action": "Introduced.

The bill would revise the membership of the board and task the board with, among other things, developing and continuously improving the statewide workforce investment system.\n\nThe federal Workforce Investment Act of 1998 requires the local chief elected officials in a local workforce development area to form, pursuant to specified guidelines, a local workforce investment board to, among other things, plan and oversee the workforce investment system and develop a comprehensive 5-year local plan. Existing law requires the Governor to establish, through the California Workforce Investment Board, standards for certification of high-performance local workforce investment boards, in accordance with specified criteria. Existing law requires a youth council be established within each local board and specified the duties of the council. Existing law also requires local workforce investment boards to spend a certain percentage of available federal funds for in a manner consistent with federal law, as prescribed.\n\nThis bill would rename the local boards as local workforce development boards, would revise the timeline for certifications of high-performance local workforce development boards, revise the guidelines used to appoint members of the local boards, and revise the duties of the local board consistent with the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014. The bill would, with regard to the provision of services to youth, instead authorize a local board to establish a standing committee on the provision of youth services, as provided. This bill would require the local boards to develop a comprehensive 4-year local plan, revise the content of the local plan, and revise the manner by which the board shares that plan with the public. This bill would impose new requirements on local boards in conformance with federal law, thereby imposing a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

This bill would authorize a certified nurse-midwife to provide peripartum care in an out-of-hospital setting to low-risk women with uncomplicated singleton-term pregnancies who are expected to have uncomplicated birth.\n\n(3) The act authorizes a certified nurse-midwife to furnish and order drugs or devices incidentally to the provision of family planning services, routine health care or perinatal care, and care rendered consistently with the certified nurse-midwife's educational preparation in specified facilities and clinics, and only in accordance with standardized procedures and protocols, as specified.\n\nThis bill would delete the requirement that drugs or devices are furnished or ordered in accordance with standardized procedures and protocols.

The act requires a local agency or school district that initiates proceedings for a change of local government organization or reorganization, by submitting a resolution of application to a local agency formation commission, to also submit a plan for providing services within the affected territory, as specified.\n\nThis bill would, in the case of a disincorporation or reorganization that includes a disincorporation, require the plan for services to include specific provisions, including, among others, an enumeration and description of the services currently provided by the city proposed for disincorporation and an outline of current retirement obligations, as specified.\n\n(2) The act requires a petitioner or legislative body desiring to initiate proceedings to submit an application to the executive officer of the local agency formation commission, and requires the local agency formation commission, with regard to an application that includes an incorporation, to immediately notify all affected local agencies and any applicable state agency, as specified.\n\nThis bill would extend that requirement to an application that includes a disincorporation.\n\n(3) Existing law prohibits the commission from approving or conditionally approving a proposal for an incorporation unless the commission finds, among other things, that the proposal is consistent with the intent of the act, the incorporation is consistent with the spheres of influence of affected local agencies, and the proposed city is expected to receive revenues sufficient to provide public services and facilities and a reasonable reserve during the three fiscal years following incorporation.\n\nThis bill would additionally prohibit the commission from approving or conditionally approving a proposal that includes a disincorporation unless the commission finds, among other things, that the disincorporation is consistent with the intent of the act, the disincorporation will address necessary changes to spheres of influence of affected agencies, and the service responsibilities of the city proposed for disincorporation have been assigned, as specified.\n\n(4) Existing law requires the executive officer of the commission to prepare a comprehensive fiscal analysis for any proposal that includes an incorporation, as specified.\n\nThis bill would additionally require the executive officer to prepare a comprehensive fiscal analysis for any proposal that includes a disincorporation, as specified. \n\n(5) Existing law requires the commission to determine the amount of property tax revenue to be exchanged by the affected local agency for a proposal that includes the incorporation of a city, and sets forth the procedures to be followed in making that determination.\n\nThis bill would additionally require the commission to determine the amount of property tax revenue to be exchanged by the affected city and any successor agency or affected local agency for a proposal that includes a disincorporation of a city, and would set forth the procedures to be followed in making that determination.\n\nThe bill would additionally require the commission to determine, where the proposal includes the disincorporation of a city with the assignment of property tax revenues to a successor agency, the increase of the appropriations limit for the successor agency or agencies, if the successor agency or agencies are existing entities, or the appropriations limit for a new special district, as specified. \n\nThe bill would state the intent of the Legislature that a proposal that includes a disincorporation of a city result in a determination that the debt or contractual obligations and responsibilities of the city being disincorporated be the responsibility of the same territory for repayment. The bill would require, prior to issuance of a certificate for filing for a proposal that includes a disincorporation, specified information relating to the debts and contractual obligations of the city being disincorporated.\n\n(6) Existing law authorizes the commission, in approving a disincorporation of a city, the dissolution of a district, or the reorganization or consolidation of agencies that result in the dissolution of one or more districts or disincorporation of one or more cities, to make the approval conditional upon the agency being dissolved not approving any increase in compensation or benefits for specified officers of the agency, or appropriating, encumbering, expending, or otherwise obligating any revenue of the agency beyond that provided in the current budget at the time the dissolution is approved by the commission, unless it first finds that an emergency exists.\n\nThis bill would modify this provision to authorize the commission to make the approval conditional upon a condition prohibiting the district that is being dissolved or the city that is being disincorporated from approving any increase in compensation or benefits for specified officers of the agency, or appropriating, encumbering, expending, or otherwise obligating any revenue of the agency beyond that provided in the current budget at the time the dissolution is approved by the commission, unless it first finds that an emergency exists.\n\nThe act also authorizes the commission to require a single question appearing on the ballot upon issues of annexation and reorganization in any election at which the questions of annexation and district reorganization or incorporation and district reorganization are to be considered at the same time. \n\nThis bill would additionally apply these provisions to a disincorporation and district reorganization.\n\n(7) Existing law requires every public officer of a city being disincorporated, prior to the effective date of the disincorporation, to turn the public property in his or her possession over to the board of supervisors.\n\nThis bill would repeal this provision. \n\n(8) The act requires the commission, after ascertaining that the disincorporation has carried, to determine and certify in a written statement to the board of supervisors the indebtedness of the city, the amount of money in its treasury, and the amount of any tax levy or other obligation due the city that is unpaid or has not been collected.\n\nThis bill would repeal this provision. \n\n(9) Existing law requires the board of supervisors to make specified determinations if the commission does not provide the board with a statement of those determinations.\n\nThis bill would repeal this provision.\n\n(10) Existing law requires the tax collector to collect any tax that has been levied by a disincorporated city that remains uncollected when due and pay it into the county treasury.\n\nThis bill would provide that the tax collected and paid into the county treasury is on behalf of the designated successor agency or county to wind up affairs of the disincorporated city.\n\n(11) Existing law requires the board of supervisors of a county to cause taxes to be levied and collected from within the territory formerly included within a disincorporated city, if there is not sufficient money in the treasury of a disincorporated city to the credit of the special fund to pay any city indebtedness as it becomes due. Existing law provides that any taxes levied pursuant to this provision are to be assessed, levied, and collected in the same manner and at the same time as other county taxes, and are additional taxes upon the property included within the territory of the disincorporated city.\n\nThis bill would repeal these provisions.\n\n(12) Existing law requires the board of supervisors to levy a special tax upon all property within the disincorporated city if the revenues from specified public utilities are not sufficient for the administration, conduct, or improvement of the public utility. Existing law requires all sums collected to be placed in a separate fund in the county treasury for the administration, conduct, and improvement of the public utility for which the tax is levied.\n\nThis bill would repeal these provisions. \n\n(13) Existing law requires the board of supervisors to annually, at the time other county taxes are levied and collected, to levy and collect a special tax on the remainder of the territory of a disincorporated city sufficient to pay the balance of the debt, and pay that sum to the city treasurer. Existing law requires the city treasurer to pay the bonded indebtedness as it becomes due with the proceeds of those taxes.\n\nThis bill would repeal these provisions.\n\n(14) Existing law provides that on and after the effective date of a disincorporation, the territory of the disincorporated city, all inhabitants within the territory, and all persons formerly entitled to vote by reason of residing within the territory cease to be subject to the jurisdiction of the disincorporated city and have none of the rights or duties of inhabitants or voters of a city.\n\nThis bill would additionally provide that as of the effective date of a disincorporation, the general plan of the general plan of the disincorporated city that was in effect immediately prior to the effective date of the disincorporation constitutes the community plan of the county for the territory of the disincorporated city, the zoning ordinances of the disincorporation that were in effect immediately prior to the effective date of the disincorporation constitute the zoning ordinances of the county for that territory, and any conditional use permit or legal nonconforming use that was in place immediately prior to the effective date of the disincorporation remains in force pursuant to the community plan and zoning ordinances. The bill would provide that any use of land that was authorized under the general plan and zoning ordinances immediately prior to the effective date of the disincorporation continues to be authorized, consistent with the requirements of that community plan and those zoning ordinances, for at least 10 years following the effective date of the disincorporation, as specified.

Because the bill would expand the application of the above county administered programs, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would make other technical, nonsubstantive changes.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.", "chamber": "lower", "bill_id": "AB 885"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00016426"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [], "actor": "lower", "action": "Read first time.

STRS is governed by the Teachers' Retirement Board. Existing law defines credited service for these purposes as service from which required contributions have been paid. Existing law permits the board to amend the plan to dispense with payment for amounts less than $10. Existing law permits specified employers participating in STRS, if it is in the best interests of the school district or office of education, to grant an additional 2 years of service credit in order to encourage retirement, if specified conditions are met. Existing law authorizes specified payments made pursuant to the Teachers' Retirement Law, including disability retirement benefits and compensation for postretirement activities, to be reduced if they are in excess of specified limits. Existing law permits members retired for disability or service from STRS to perform member activities without reinstatement into the system if certain conditions are met.\n\nThis bill would revise the definition of credited service for purposes of STRS to include service for which required contributions would have been made in absence of specified federal limits. The bill would revise the provisions authorizing the board to dispense with the payment for amounts less than $10 to be more specific in regard to the types of payments and to include adjustments to those payments. The bill would require, in regard to the grant of additional service credit to encourage retirement, to require as a condition of that grant that necessary documentation be provided to the retirement system within a specified time. The bill would make various technical changes to accurately cross-reference current law regarding contributions to fund the system. The bill would specify how reductions in payments are to be made in connection with the amount received in a particular month. The bill would make other technical, conforming changes, and corrections.\n\nExisting law establishes the Cash Balance Benefit Program, administered by the Teachers' Retirement Board, as a separate benefit program within the State Teachers' Retirement Plan in order to provide a retirement plan for persons employed to perform creditable service for less than 50% of full-time service. Existing law states legislative findings and declarations regarding the purpose of the Cash Balance Plan offered pursuant to the program. Existing law defines a participant for these purposes and prescribes the circumstances pursuant to which a person is permitted to participate in the program and how participation may be terminated and service be subject to the Defined Benefit Program offered by STRS. Existing law provides that the normal form of retirement benefit under the Cash Balance Benefit Program is a lump-sum payment.\n\nThis bill would revise the statement of legislative findings regarding the Cash Balance Benefit Program to specify that it applies to a person working for an employer, except a community college district, that offers the plan, a person who is employed on temporary basis, as specified, by a community college district offering the plan, or a person employed as a substitute employee. The bill would revise the definition of a participant in the plan to require that he or she has not received a lump-sum retirement benefit, as specified. The bill would define the system's headquarters office for purposes of the program. The bill would revise the circumstances pursuant to which a person providing creditable service would be eligible to participate in the plan with reference to whether a person has elected an alternative retirement program, whether a participant's employment with a community college district precludes continued participation in the plan, and how a substitute employee may become and remain a member of the plan. The bill would prohibit payment of a lump-sum retirement benefit before 180 days have elapsed following termination of employment and would require automatic termination of an application for the retirement benefit based on the participant performing creditable service with 180 days of terminating employment, except as specified. The bill would specify how reductions in payments under the Cash Balance Benefit Program are to be made in connection with the amount received in a particular month. The bill would require, with regard to a participant retired for service, that the retired participant application for the retirement benefit be canceled automatically if he or she is anticipated to receive the retirement in a lump-sum payment and earns compensation for performing creditable service with 180 days after termination of employment.

The Department of Justice has related investigatory and enforcement duties under the act. Any violation of these provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor, as specified.\n\nThis bill, which would be known as the Internet Poker Consumer Protection Act of 2015, would establish a framework to authorize intrastate Internet poker, as specified. The bill would authorize eligible entities to apply to the commission for a 10-year nontransferable license to operate an intrastate Internet poker Web site offering the play of authorized Internet poker games to registered players within California, as specified. The bill would require that the license be automatically renewed every 10 years upon application, as specified. The bill would prohibit the offer or play of any gambling game provided over the Internet that is not an authorized Internet poker game permitted by the state pursuant to this bill. The bill would provide that it is unlawful for a person to aggregate computers or any other device with Internet access capabilities in a place of public accommodation within the state, including a public or private club or other association, in a public or private setting, that can accommodate multiple players to simultaneously play authorized games on the Internet, or to promote, facilitate, or market that activity. The bill would provide that any violation of the Internet Poker Consumer Protection Act of 2015 is punishable as a misdemeanor. By creating new crimes, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would require the commission, and any other state agency with a duty pursuant to these provisions, to adopt regulations within 180 days after the operative date of this bill, in consultation with the department and federally recognized California Indian tribes, to implement these provisions, and to facilitate the operation of authorized poker Web sites and expedite the state's receipt of revenues. The bill would require an eligible entity, as defined, to pay an application processing fee sufficient to cover all reasonable costs associated with the issuance of the license, for deposit into the Internet Poker Fund, as created by the bill, to be continuously appropriated to the department and the commission in the amounts necessary to perform their duties pursuant to this bill. An operator license applicant that is a federally recognized Indian tribe also would be required to submit a limited waiver of its sovereign immunity. The bill would require a service provider to apply to the commission for a service provider license before providing goods or services to a licensed operator in connection with the operation of an authorized poker Web site and pay an application processing fee sufficient to cover the reasonable costs associated with the issuance of the license. The bill would require the department to review the suitability of a service provider applicant and would require the department, prior to issuing a service provider license, to issue a finding of suitability and conduct a full investigation of the service provider license applicant. The bill would require a marketing affiliate to apply to the commission for a marketing affiliate license or registration before providing marketing services to a licensed operator in connection with the operation of an authorized poker Web site and pay an application processing fee sufficient to cover the reasonable costs associated with the issuance of the license. Except as provided, the bill would require the department to review the suitability of a marketing affiliate license or registration applicant and would require the department, prior to issuing a license or registration, to issue a finding of suitability and conduct a full investigation of the marketing affiliate license or registration applicant.\n\nThe bill would require employees of a licensed operator, a licensed service provider, or a licensed or registered marketing affiliate to obtain employee work permits, and owners, officers, and directors of a licensed operator to be subject to a suitability review and obtain employee work permits, and would authorize the commission to refuse to issue a license to, or suspend or revoke a license of, a licensed operator that fails to comply with these requirements. The bill would establish a tribal gaming regulatory authority process for the purpose of processing employee work permits, and authorize a tribe that is a licensed operator to elect to participate in the tribal gaming regulatory authority process.\n\nThis bill would authorize the commission to revoke or suspend any license or work permit upon reaching a finding that the licensee or employee is in violation of the provisions described above, or any regulation adopted pursuant to these provisions. However, the bill would prohibit a tribal licensee from having its license suspended or revoked, or being fined or otherwise penalized for complying with any applicable federal law or regulation when operating an authorized poker Web site on Indian lands. The bill would specify that to the extent that any state requirement is more strict than any applicable federal law requirement, the tribal licensee is required to comply with the state requirement.\n\nThis bill would require a registered player account to be established in person, and would also require that specified deposits into and withdrawals out of those accounts be made in person. In order to satisfy those in-person requirements, the bill would authorize a licensed operator to enter into an agreement for the operation of one or more satellite service centers, which would be authorized to act on behalf of, or in coordination with, the licensed operator in carrying out those in-person requirements. The bill would require a licensed operator to ensure, among other things, that the satellite service center is financially, logistically, and technologically capable of performing specified duties in accordance with the bill's provisions. The bill would provide that both the satellite service center and the licensed operator may be held liable for any violation of the bill's provisions arising out of an agreement between the satellite service center and the licensed operator to provide specified in-person services. The bill would also authorize the commission to promulgate regulations regarding satellite service centers for the protection of licensed operators, registered players, and intrastate Internet poker, or that otherwise serve the purposes of the bill.\n\nThis bill would require the payment of an annual regulatory fee, for deposit into the Internet Poker Fund, to be continuously appropriated for the actual costs of license oversight, consumer protection, state regulation, and other purposes related to this bill. The bill would require each licensee to pay a one-time license deposit into the General Fund in the amount of $5,000,000. The license deposit would be credited against quarterly fees equivalent to 5% of the licensee's gross gaming revenue proceeds, as specified. The bill would require an applicant for an operator license to provide documentation establishing that the applicant is qualified to pay the one-time license deposit through its own net position or through credit directly to the applicant, as specified.\n\nThis bill would establish the Unlawful Gambling Enforcement Fund within the General Fund for purposes of ensuring adequate resources for law enforcement charged with enforcing the prohibitions and protections of the provisions described above. The bill would authorize the Attorney General, and other public prosecutors, as specified, to bring a civil action to recover a civil penalty in an unspecified amount against a person who engages in those prohibited activities described above, or other specified unlawful gambling activities. The bill would provide for an unspecified percentage of revenues from civil penalties collected to be deposited into the fund and used for law enforcement activities pursuant to these provisions, upon appropriation by the Legislature.\n\nThis bill would require the commission, in consultation with the department, the Treasurer, and the Franchise Tax Board, to issue a report to the Legislature describing the state's efforts to meet the policy goals articulated in this bill within one year of the operative date of this bill and, annually, thereafter. The bill would also require the Bureau of State Audits, at least 4 years after the issue date of any license by the state, but no later than 5 years after that date, to issue a report to the Legislature detailing the implementation of this bill, as specified.\n\nThis bill would require the state to affirmatively elect to be subject to a federal Internet gambling law, and would prohibit the state from participating in any Internet gambling agreement between states or foreign jurisdictions without an affirmative legislative act. The bill would provide that if the state elects to be subject to a federal Internet gambling law or to participate in an Internet gambling agreement between states or foreign jurisdictions, an operator licensee shall not be required to pay the one-time license fee or the quarterly fees described above and would require the state to refund within 30 days all unused license fees paid to the state, as specified. The bill would authorize a licensee to enforce this provision in the superior court.\n\nThe bill would provide that specified provisions are not severable.\n\n(2) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\n(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.\n\n(4) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.", "scraped_subjects": ["Gambling: Internet poker: unlawful gambling activity."], "bill_id": "AB 9"}, {"all_ids": ["CAB00015012"], "actions": [{"related_entities": [{"type": "committee", "name": "Standing Committee on Rules", "id": "CAC000778"}], "actor": "upper", "action": "Introduced.
